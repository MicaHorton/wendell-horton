# How To Use Latex Documents
- Use Pandoc to convert text macros. It will convert some math macros to MathML.
- Use MathJax to style the rest of the math macros (that are still LaTex.) Also, improves browser support for MathML. 
- Prettify the HTML using an online converter. Change class to className.
- Style the HTML and inline-math with CSS.
