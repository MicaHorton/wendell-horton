# Wendell Horton's Website
This is a website for my grandfather, who wanted to publish one of his books online. This website includes a little about him, and his books (written in LaTex converted into a website.) I'm still in the progress of converting and publishing all the chapters, but you can check out the current version at fusionpedia.org!

## Technologies Used
- HTML & CCS
- React Framework
- Pandoc (to convert LaTex to HTML)
- MathJax
- AWS Amplify
