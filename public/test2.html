                <h2>The Greifswald Stellarator machine W7X makes a breakthrough with <span class="math inline"><strong>10</strong> </span>KeV hydrogen plasma driven by high–power RF heating avoiding the Mega–Amperes of plasma currents</h2>
                    <p>Wendelstein 7–X (W7–X) was operated successfully with the first divertor plasma in the operation phase 1.2a (OP1.2a). A new combined probe head, developed and installed on the multiple–purpose manipulator, is able to measure the edge plasma profiles (<span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>e</em></sub>, <em>n</em><sub><em>e</em></sub>, <em>ϕ</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>M</em><sub>∥</sub></span>), variation of magnetic field, poloidal and radial turbulence structures. The Scrape–Off Layer (SOL) plasma parameters in two magnetic configurations (standard and high mirror) are in good agreement with the magnetic island structure and the field line connection length calculated by the field line tracer. In both the standard and high mirror configurations, the radial turbulent heat flux and particle flux have strong dependence on the local magnetic topology, revealing two distinct transport patterns: a broadband turbulence dominant region in the outer SOL and a low–frequency dominant region in the inner SOL. In the standard divertor configuration, the broadband turbulence with a frequency range of 40-120<span class="math inline"> </span>kHz is located near the island center along the probe path, leading to outward transport. These broadband fluctuations propagate with a velocity of 2.3-4.6<span class="math inline"> </span>km/s poloidally along the ion diamagnetic drift direction in the plasma frame, with <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub><em>ρ</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, close to 0.1. The large radial transport induced by the broadband turbulence is accompanied by a steep electron density gradient. The low frequency (0-30<span class="math inline"> </span>kHz) dominant transport exhibits obvious intermittent structure. Some statistical techniques are applied to the characterization of the intermittent transport.</p>

                        <p>Both the early intro–ELM and inter–ELM periods produce inputs of tungsten and beryllium ions into the core plasma under a variety of conditions. Theoretical modeling and comparisons with data from the fusion tokamaks WEST, EAST, KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research), JET (Joint European Torus) and DIII–D (Doublet III) show that the inward fluxes of impurity ions and their accumulation conditions are critical issues for ITER. <em>Michoski, et al.</em> (2017) and <em>Michoski and Horton</em> (2019) used theoretical models and simulations for the vessel–wall emission problem combined with drift wave impurity transport formulas.

The research produces models for the rate of accumulations of Be and W ions during an ELM event and during minor disruptions. A set of impurity transport equations is solved using formulas for impurity fluxes driven by drift waves with ion particles and hydrogen isotopes.

                    <h3>Local turbulence measurements in the Large Helical Device by phase contrast imaging</h3>
                        <p>Two–dimensional phase contrast imaging (2D) installed on the Large Helical Device (LHD) is a unique diagnostic for local turbulence measurements. Using a <span class="math inline">10.6 </span>micron infrared CO<span class="math inline"><sub>2</sub></span> laser and a <span class="math inline">6 × 8</span> channel HgCdTe 2D detector are used. The length of the scattering volume is larger than plasma size. However, the asymmetry of turbulence structure with respect to the magnetic field and magnetic shear make local turbulence measurements possible. From a 2D image of the integrated fluctuations, the spatial cross–correlation function is estimated using time domain correlation analysis, then, the integrated 2D <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>–spectrum is obtained using maximum entropy method.</p>
                        <p>The 2D <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>–spectrum is converted from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates. Finally, the angle in cylindrical coordinate is converted to flux surface labels. The fluctuation profile over almost the entire plasma diameter can be obtained at a single moment. The measurable <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>–region can be varied by adjusting the detection optics. In the LHD plasma, <span class="math inline">$k=1-10\,\rm cm^{-1}$</span> fluctuations are measured which is expected region of ion temperature gradient and trapped electron turbulence in LHD. The spatial resolution is 10%–50% of the plasma minor radius [<em>Tanaka, et al.</em> (2008)].</p>

The core plasma density and pressure exceeded <span class="math inline">$10^{21}\rm m^{-3}$</span> and <span class="math inline">150 </span>kPa in 1989 with an internal transport barrier. The foot point of the Internal Diffusion Barrier extends to the last closed magnetic surface at <span class="math inline"></span> to <span class="math inline">4.0 </span>m.</p>
                
                        <h2>Gamma 10 Mirror–Confined Plasmas</h2>
                    <p>The electric potential experiments on GAMMA–10 [<em>Cho, et al.</em> (2008)] are consistent with the potential results on the Norman (TAE–x) field–reversed plasmas. The mirror plasma–parameter improvement is essential. The Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) and H–mode pedestal in tokamaks has similar physics enhancing the plasma confinement.</p>
                    <p>In the central cell of GAMMA–10 the ECH injection raises <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span> from <span class="math inline">100 </span>eV to <span class="math inline">1000 </span>eV in association with an increase in the ion temperature <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> from <span class="math inline">500 </span>eV to <span class="math inline">1 </span>KeV because of a significant reduction of electron drag from KeV electron temperature and the ICH ion heating produced by hot ions in the central cell with <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> ∼ 1 </span>KeV. The ECH heating level was <span class="math inline">'$P_'{'\rm ECH'}'\le 170\,$'</span>kW [<em>Pratt and Horton</em> (2006)].</p>
                    <p>The experiments showed that ECH heating with high–power gyrotrons for bulk electron heating may produce plasma with fusion–grade parameters.</p>
                    <p>Tandem mirror plasmas show that radial transport barriers can be produced by the use of off–axis ECH electron heating. This off–axis application of the ECH produces a radial electric field profile that controls the electron end losses. A cylindrical shell of high–energy electron is a layer at <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 4-7 </span>cm are formed from the barrier through the central cell and into the end region. <span class="math inline">2 </span>KeV but with low density relative to the bulk electrons. The electron end losses from the layer result in the formation of a positive ambipolar potential and disrupts confining ions locally near <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 4-7 </span>cm because of loss of negatively–charged electrons.</p>
                    <p>The potential hills in turn make the change in the sign of <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>(<em>r</em>)</span> at the local peak position of the potential hill near <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 4-7 </span>cm. The <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span> reversal leads to the direction reversal of the sheared <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>(<em>r</em>) × <em>B</em>(<em>z</em>)</span> drift flow in the azimuthal (theta) direction at the potential peak radius similar to the Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) in toroidal devices. As a result, turbulence and intermittent vortex–like structures in hot–ion plasmas are suppressed near the reversal layer. Such a sheared <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>(<em>r</em>)</span> formation and a separation between the internal and outward plasmas due to the layer at <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 4-7 </span>cm [<em>Cho, et al.</em> (2008)] results in the enhancement of temperature gradients in the layer. The thermal isolation effects make <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> increase in the internal region in the low–density plasma layer formed by the ECH barrier.</p>
                    <h3>Shearless local ITB transport barriers in tokamaks produced by control of the radial electric field</h3>
                        <p>In tokamaks, internal transport barriers are observed and measured when <span class="math inline"><em>q</em>(<em>r</em>)</span> has a minimum <span class="math inline">$q_{\rm min}$</span>. They are produced by modifications of the toroidal plasma current profile. The internal <span class="math inline">$q_{\rm min}$</span> surface separates the rational surfaces which reduces particle transport and improves plasma confinement [<em>Marcus, et al.</em> (2019)]. The triggering of the internal transport barriers and their dependence on the plasma profiles is a key nonlinear dynamics problem under current investigation. In tokamaks, internal transport barriers are produced by <span class="math inline">$q_{\rm min}$</span> from the plasma current profile by modifications of the plasma current profile, which reduces particle transport and improves plasma confinement. Progress to understand this reduction, the triggering of internal transport barriers and its dependence with the plasma profiles is an active research area [<em>Rowan, et al.</em> (2008)]. The onset of shearless invariant curves inside the plasma creates <span class="math inline">$q_{\rm min}$</span> internal transport barriers. A nonintegrable drift–kinetic model is used to describe particle transport driven by drift waves for large aspect ratio tokamaks to investigate the onset and growth of these internal transport barriers. Currently observed plasma profiles, shearless particle transport barriers can be triggered by properly modifying the <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>E</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span> electric field profile and the influence of nonresonant modes in the barriers onset [<em>Miura, et al.</em> (2017)]. In particular, a broken barrier can be restored by enhancing nonresonant modes <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ϕ</em><sub><em>m</em>, <em>n</em></sub>(<em>r</em>)</span> for <span class="math inline"><em>q</em>(<em>r</em><sub>0</sub>) ≠ <em>m</em>/<em>n</em></span> or eliminating <span class="math inline"><em>q</em> = <em>m</em>/<em>n</em></span> surface.</p>
                        <p><em>Marcus, et al.</em> (2019) develop the internal <span class="math inline">$q_{\rm min}$</span> creates the onset of shearless invariant curves inside the plasma which produces an internal transport barrier. A nonintegrable drift–kinetic model is used to describe particle transport driven by drift waves and to investigate the onset of these shearless barriers in tokamaks. Shearless particle transport barriers can be triggered by properly modifying the electric field profiles and the influence of nonresonant modes in the barriers onset [<em>Miura, et al.</em> (2017)]. In particular, the broken barrier can be restored by enhancing the neighboring nonresonant modes, as shown in theory and simulations by <em>Marcus, et al.</em> (2019).</p>
