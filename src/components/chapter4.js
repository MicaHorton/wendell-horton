                <h2>The Greifswald Stellarator machine W7X makes a breakthrough with <span class="math inline"><strong>10</strong> </span>KeV hydrogen plasma driven by high–power RF heating avoiding the Mega–Amperes of plasma currents</h2>
                    <p>Wendelstein 7–X (W7–X) was operated successfully with the first divertor plasma in the operation phase 1.2a (OP1.2a). A new combined probe head, developed and installed on the multiple–purpose manipulator, is able to measure the edge plasma profiles (<span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>e</em></sub>, <em>n</em><sub><em>e</em></sub>, <em>ϕ</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>M</em><sub>∥</sub></span>), variation of magnetic field, poloidal and radial turbulence structures. The Scrape–Off Layer (SOL) plasma parameters in two magnetic configurations (standard and high mirror) are in good agreement with the magnetic island structure and the field line connection length calculated by the field line tracer. In both the standard and high mirror configurations, the radial turbulent heat flux and particle flux have strong dependence on the local magnetic topology, revealing two distinct transport patterns: a broadband turbulence dominant region in the outer SOL and a low–frequency dominant region in the inner SOL. In the standard divertor configuration, the broadband turbulence with a frequency range of 40-120<span class="math inline"> </span>kHz is located near the island center along the probe path, leading to outward transport. These broadband fluctuations propagate with a velocity of 2.3-4.6<span class="math inline"> </span>km/s poloidally along the ion diamagnetic drift direction in the plasma frame, with <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub><em>ρ</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, close to 0.1. The large radial transport induced by the broadband turbulence is accompanied by a steep electron density gradient. The low frequency (0-30<span class="math inline"> </span>kHz) dominant transport exhibits obvious intermittent structure. Some statistical techniques are applied to the characterization of the intermittent transport.</p>
