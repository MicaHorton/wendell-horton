\chapter{International Treaty Agreement to Build D--T Fusion Power Reactor Producing a Tokamak with Output Power 10X the injected heating power}

\section{The Technical Design Effort and Cost to Build a Power--producing Plasma --- Like a star --- in the Laboratory Led to the ITER Treaty}

\subsection{Steady--state lower--hybrid RF current drive produces steady--state plasmas eliminating runaway electrons}

To maintain steady--state or hour--long pulse--fusion plasmas, one must use high--power RF driven waves launched from antennas along the vessel walls. The first successful steady--state toroidal plasmas were demonstrated in Tore Supra using Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD). The steady--state experiments are described and reviewed in Chapter 13 of {\it Turbulent Transport in Magnetized Plasmas}, 2nd Ed., \emph{Horton} (2018) ISBN:978--981--3225--86--6.

Long--pulse tokamak operation requires the change from the inductive transformer--driven toroidal electric field to steady--state plasmas with radio frequency RF antennas for driving the plasma current. The most effective RF current driver for the development of a fusion power reactor is the Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD).

The first phase of plasma formation with inductive start--up electric fields from the tokamak transformer shows the development of electron distribution functions with parallel momentum electron groups that are continuously accelerated by the inductive electric fields. The energy gain of these runaway electrons must be terminated or controlled by RF waves tuned to push the relativistic electrons to the radial edge of the trapped plasma through the magnetic separatrix [\emph{Fontanilla and Breizman} (2017), \emph{Breizman and Aleynikov} (2017)]. Without control of the runaway electrons, severe damage to the metal vessel wall occurs.

The RF current drive works from wall--mounted antennas with large phased arrays of TE$_{1,0}$ wave guides that launch focused quasi--electrostatic 3-$5\,$GHz lower hybrid plasma waves at about one--half the speed of light in the direction opposite to the toroidal plasma current. Modeling of the LHCD with the Tore Supra group [\emph{Horton, et al.} (2013)] and continuing this work for the Tungsten Environment in Steady-State Tokamak (WEST) and Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) tokamaks [\emph{Horton, et al.} (2017) {\it Santa Monica RF Conference}] explains the measured toroidal plasma currents.

Work continues on understanding the (LHCH) experiments with a magnetic separatrix that isolates the wall plasma from the hot core plasma. The WEST machine is a modification of Tore Supra with tungsten chamber walls inserted to model the walls needed for a reactor at a small scale. New issues arose in attempting to reproduce the earlier results from Tore Supra with circular flux surfaces. WEST has a lower single--null tungsten divertor which makes the modeling and dynamics more complex. Simulation codes take into account the wall shape and the X--point on the separatrix [\emph{Horton, et al.}, {\it Santa Monica Proceedings of RF Conference} (2017), Aix--en Provence, June (2017) to model WEST and EAST [\emph{Goniche, et al.} (2019), \emph{Decker, et al.} (2011), \emph{Peysson, et al.} (2011, 2016), \emph{Goniche, et al.} (2019), \emph{Hoang, et al.} (2003), \emph{Horton, et al.} (2013a,b, 2017)].

For steady--state or long--pulse tokamak operation Lower--Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is required and the extended, asymmetric electron distribution $f_e(p_\|,\ p_\perp, r, t)$ changes the stability of the Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence driven by fast electrons. This interaction modifies both electron current--carrying distribution function and the state of the ETG plasma turbulence. The ETG turbulence also scatters the RF waves used in the diagnostics systems essential to measuring and controlling the tokamak plasma.

Wall erosion from the multi--KeV electron plasmas driven for minutes by the Klystrons is observed and requires further investigation. Full wave codes and RF ray simulation codes are used to test the theoretical formulas derived for steady--state RF operation. Modeling includes the angle scattering of the RF rays off the low--frequency drift wave turbulence that is modified by the anisotropic electron momentum distributions that extend from 3-$4v_e$ up to the antenna--launched RF phase velocity at approximately one--half the speed of light. Examples of the plasma turbulence producing the RF wave scattering are shown in Fig.~\ref{F6.2}.

Density fluctuations from the ETG--driven drift waves scatter the gigaHertz RF waves from the slow wave polarization (quasi--electrostatic lower hybrid wave) into the fast wave --- or whistler --- RF wave polarization. The density fluctuation scattering and the coupling of the slow to the fast RF waves is computed and gives RF spectra closer to those measured in WEST and EAST than calculations without the RF scattering.

Secondly, the importance of including the scattering of the launched RF waves into the longer wavelength fast waves is that the scattering increases the RF current drive in the core plasma. The core current drive is missed by models that only follow the launched slow RF waves. Both simulations and data for the WEST and EAST current drive experiments need the fast RF waves to explain the observed electron X--ray spectrum. (EAST launches $3\,$GHz and Tore Supra/WEST launches $5\,$GHz LHCD RF waves). The RF wave scattering broadens the fast electron distributions producing the observed X--ray spectrum and giving the larger core toroidal currents than those derived from the electrostatic LHCD RF codes [\emph{Horton, et al.} (2017)] that neglect the coupling to the fast waves (DIII--D).

\subsection{Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) for control of 3/2 and 2/1 magnetic islands and steady--state tokamak plasmas in DIII--D, EAST and KSTAR}

DIII--D demonstrated the use of RF Doppler Backscattering (DBS) experiments for measuring the radial distribution of the resonant ECH driven electron heating and the associated modification or control of the toroidal plasma current [\emph{Brookman, et al.} (2017)]. The ECH theory and modeling are essential for developing real--time control of the growth of magnetic islands at the $q(r)=3/2$ and 2/1 rational surfaces. Theoretical analysis of the RF code data from LUKE/C3P0 and GENRAY simulations for the experiments with six $110\,$GHz gyrotrons producing the Doppler Backscattering (DBS) database. With modeling of the ``$B_t$--jog" diagnostic technique [\emph{Houshmandyar, et al.} (2017)], one is able to interpret the interplay of the ECH RF waves with the ETG turbulence.

Both DIII--D data and earlier data from Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) is analyzed to determine the required focusing and to estimate the total RF gyrotron powers needed to stop, or control, the growth of the magnetic islands. Without the RF control the island growth leads to plasma disruptions and events that lower the plasma $Q_{\rm DT}$ by significant factors. Near real--time RF ECH plasma control is now understood to be essential for steady tokamak operation.

\subsection{Direct $\nabla T_e$ measurements with high spatial resolution of $T_e$--profiles using electron cyclotron emission}

Electron Cyclotron Emission (ECE) diagnostics use Yttrium--Iron--Garnet (YIG) bandpass filters to measure with precision the electron temperature $T_e(r, t)$ profiles and their fluctuations $\delta T_e$. These $(x,t)$ variable bandpass frequency filters were compared with fixed frequency filters and shown to give higher resolution electron temperature measurements. \emph{Houshmandyar, et al.} (2018) present proof--of--principle for high temporal resolution measurements of the electron temperature gradient by using real--time slewing with a YIG bandpass filter for measuring the location of an ECE channel during a long pulse. The key instrument uses the application of YIG tunable filters with their narrow bandwidths and capability for a high slew rate of their center frequency. This instrument permits fast relocation of the ECE channels for direct measurement of the temperature gradients with close spacing of channels to study the dynamics of the magnetic islands.

ECE diagnostics are essential to tokamaks and all fusion machines. Employing narrow bandwidth bandpass filters in the Intermediate Frequency (IF) section of a radiometer ECE diagnostic increases the spatial resolution of $T_e$--profile [\emph{Troung, et al.} (2014)] and sensitivity for $T_e$--fluctuation $(\delta T_e)$ [\emph{Fontana, et al.} (2017)] measurements. Utilizing Yttrium--Iron--Garnet (YIG) bandpass filters reduces the threshold for the $\delta T_e$ measurements. These instruments are critical for correlational ECE measurements for turbulent transport studies [\emph{Fontana, et al.} (2018)]. The tunable feature of the YIG filters yields the flexibility for moving the ECE channels to different spatial regions during a single discharge. This is important in plasma control during the fast rearranging of the ECE channels to the moving rational surfaces. This diagnostic generates enough information for the actuators to control the Neoclassical Tearing Modes (NTM).

\subsection{Impurity ion injection for controlling transport dynamics in tokamak plasmas}

The JET ITER--Like Wall (JET--ILW) experiments [\emph{Lang, et al.} (2013)] showed that predicting and control of the wall erosion and the inward transport of high--$Z$ ions from the tungsten W wall coatings is critical for maintaining steady fusion power plasmas.

In order to obtain a better understanding of tungsten (W) transport processes, we are developing the Monte Carlo W transport code (IMPGYRO). The code has the following characteristics which are important for calculating the tungsten W transport: (1)~the exact Larmor motion of W ions is computed so that the effects of orbital drifts are automatically taken into account; (2)~Coulomb collisions between W impurities and background plasma ions are modeled using the Binary Collision Model which provides more precise kinetic calculations of the friction and thermal forces. By using the IMPGYRO code, the W ion production/transport in the ITER geometry is calculated under two different divertor operation modes (Case A: partially detached state and Case B: high recycling state) obtained from the SOLPS--ITER code suite calculations without the effect of drifts. The results of the W--density in the upstream Scrape--off Layer (SOL) strongly depends on the divertor operation mode. From the comparison of the W impurity transport between Case~A and Case~B, obtaining a partially--detached state is shown to be effective in reducing the W--impurities in the upstream SOL. The limitations of the model and the validity of the above results are discussed and summarized for further applications of IMPGYRO code to ITER plasmas [\emph{Yamoto, et al.} (2017)].

\subsection{RF wave control of steady--state fusion plasmas}

RF waves are an irreplaceable tool for plasma current-drive and for controlling plasma instabilities. RF research quantitatively predicts how the SOL turbulence and core turbulence scatter the RF waves leading to deposition profiles that strongly modify currents given by neoclassical and collisional transport models. This RF power leads to and couples directly to the wall erosion mechanisms through the development of plasma wall dust and impurity transport from the SOL through the magnetic separatrix into the core plasma. Elucidation of these critical processes brings the tokamak fusion program closer to the predictive capability that are needed for interpreting the ITER plasma data. Impurity transport models [\emph{Hazeltine} (2009)] and computer software are essential for the design of future fusion reactors.

\subsection{Impurity transport from Tracer--Encapsulated Solid Pellets\break (TESPEL) experiment in LHD with impurity diagnostics}

Experiments with additional strong auxiliary RF heating (ICH/ECH) have demonstrated the suppression and mitigation of the core impurity accumulation. The data is from the Tracer-Encapsulated Solid Pellet (TESPEL) experiments [\emph{Sudo, et al.} (2012)] on the LHD and the impurity control experiments on the W7--AS Stellarator [\emph{Burhenn, et al.} (2009)]. The Mn, Co, V injected tracer elements are between Fe, Wi and Cobalt elements used in metal plasma walls in the KSTAR [\emph{Hong, et al.} (2015)] machine.

The TESPEL experiments on the LHD used tracer elements encapsulated in balls of polystyrene with Mn, Co, V impurities in the balls of $0.1\,$mm size are injected in to the plasma. Measuring with spectrometers the emitted radiation lines gives level and spatial distribution of the impurities. Other machines with impurity control experiments are the W7--AS Stellarator [\emph{Burhenn, et al.} (2009)], and the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) tokamak [\emph{Hong, et al.} (2015)].

In the KSTAR experiments [\emph{Hong, et al.} (2015)] the addition of Electron Cyclotron RF Heating (ECH) of $1.5\,$MW $154\,$GHz ECH suppresses the impurity emission from the highly--ionized V tracer atoms. The LHD experiments show that high--power ($1.5\,$MW) $154\,$GHz ECH can reduce the accumulation of the impurities. Optimum ECH conditions (Power, Absorbed Position and Duration) are used to control the impurity accumulation.

Experiments on DIII--D traced the anomalous radial distribution of the ECH power deposition by the RF scattering from the ambient plasma turbulence. Modeling for WEST steady--state RF operation yields contributions to the core current drive that were previously missed in modeling without the plasma turbulence. The critical steps include pitch--angle scattering of the RF rays from the drift wave density turbulence as modified by the anisotropic electron momentum distributions produced from the antenna--launched RF waves phase velocities ranging from $4v_e$ to one--half the speed of light. The modeling shows how the density fluctuations from the electron temperature gradient turbulence scatter the RF waves from the slow--wave polarization (quasi--electrostatic lower hybrid waves) into the fast wave or whistler RF waves [\emph{Horton, et al.} (2017)]. This turbulence scattering is necessary to explain the measured core electron X--ray emissions. The LHCD research for WEST is reported in the RF Heating Conference Proceedings Aix en Provence, June 2017.

The plasma turbulence, due to the steep temperature gradients across the Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS), is critical in scattering the RF waves. The wave--scattering calculations show how the plasma pressure gradients drive FLR--ballooning interchange instabilities producing pulses of vortices into the SOL edge plasma [\emph{Miura, et al.} (2017, 2018)]. The anisotropies created in the ion velocity distributions span from inside the last closed flux surfaces into the Scrape--Off Layer (SOL) creating (i) the inward radial electric fields, (ii) the ion pressure anisotropy $(p_\|,p_\perp)$ and (iii) the sheared $E_r$ fields that control the Hall--MHD turbulence and (iv)~the creation of vortex structures or plasma ``blobs''.

Research on the turbulence inside and outside the last closed flux surface is a focus for future research in ITER. Work on the RF--driven plasma structures will expand rapidly in the coming years with high priority for modeling steady--state fusion plasmas.\\

\noindent{\bf 1. Tokamak/Stellarator vs. FRC: transport and other fundamentals 
(Y. Kishimoto and T. Tajima)}\\

Plasma, highly--nonlinear medium consisting of ions and electrons, exhibits prominent characteristics, self--organization and structure formation, once several conditions are fulfilled. In some cases, the are expected and useful in achieving a purpose, while in some cases, accidental and eliminated. Fusion device, one of the promising plasma applications for future energy resource, is designed so as to minimize macro and microinstabilities in achieving high stability and confinement, so that the characteristics are of specific importance [\emph{Horton} (1999)]. When we design a device, we usually reply on the linear aspect, while uncertain whether the characteristics, i.e. the self--organization and structure formation, support the approach or lead contradiction.

Tokamaks and stellarators have strong toroidal magnetic fields and additional magnetic field, i.e. poloidal magnetic field, by plasma current in tokamaks and by external coil in stellarators, so that the latter is more rigid than the former, which possess more freedom in magnetic configuration. Such magnetic structures are designed to have magnetic shear in minimizing various instabilities from the linear aspect while is found to induce the overlap of drift wave ``islands'' called streamers, i.e. global modes, and causes avalanche--like intermittent bursts leading to self--organized critical transport [\emph{Kishimoto, et al.} (1996)]. This is peculiar to so called L--mode that causes anomalous ion/electron diffusion known as the Bohm transport. A recipe to prevent such anomalous diffusion is to weaken and/or eliminate the magnetic shear by the reversal of magnetic shear or by the annihilation of streamers by the additional electric field generated shear, which leads to high confinement state, e.g. internal transport barrier.

We compare and understand that the presence of null magnetic shear in stellarator enhances its confinement, much the similar way to the above tokamak's local shearlessness contributing to the enhanced confinement [\emph{Ishizawa, et al.} (2016)]. Namely, through the series of research on fusion devices with strong and then rigid guiding magnetic field, we found a reciprocal relation between linear stability and nonlinear turbulent transport as that the configuration with more unstable smaller magnetic shear plasma provides smaller turbulent transport nonlinearly than that with moderate shear. This suggests that softening the (``rigidness'' of the system is of importance for the plasma to be self--organized in keeping higher stability and confinement.

From this viewpoint, high--energy beam assisted FRC [\emph{Binderbauer, et al.} (2015)] is charming system. FRC is devoid of strong shell--like' fields and thus is bound to be wobbly. First, the FRC core is devoid of magnetic shear (an agent of the radial extended transport channels). Secondly, the core is devoid of the instability driving mechanism of drift wave due to the Finite Larmor Radius (FLR), short electron connection length, and reversed $\nabla-B$ drift. However, the beam--driven FRC has an entirely additional dimension. The beam introduces the backbone to the overall plasma that makes FRC globally stable, while enhanced FLR due to the beam further solidifies the FRC stability. The additional but not yet well--known robustness of the beam--FRC combo is the principle that the beam--induced waves with high phase velocity cannot destroy the plasma confinement, just similar to the intense wake field not destroying the plasma accelerator. We are planning to check this point by our gyrokinetic code of FRC.

\subsection{Reduction of edge plasma turbulence via cross--phase coherence decrease by zonal fields}

Transport of the near--adiabatic plasma is readily and widely simulated numerically. The Zonal Flow (ZF) along the poloidal direction is found to emerge self--consistently from the turbulence. Zonal flow $V(n)$ fields are found to feed back to turbulence by reducing the cross phase. As a result, the turbulence is localized with depressed peaks. Turbulence is low and the cross phase $\delta$ is negative near $V=0$, where the gradient $V'$ (vorticity) of the ZF along the radial direction is large. The fluctuations are almost localized where the zonal--density gradient $\overline n'$ is a positive peak and $V$ is locally large. Positive $\overline n'$ or positive $V'S$ is shown to reduce the cross phase between the electric potential and the density fluctuation [\emph{Kim, et al.} (2019)].\\

\noindent{\bf 2. Action principles for extended magnetohydrodynamic models}\\

The general, nondissipative, two--fluid model in plasma physics is Hamiltonian, but this property is sometimes lost or obscured in the process of deriving simplified (or reduced) two--fluid or one--fluid models from the plasma fluid  plasma equations of motion. To ensure that the reduced models have a Hamiltonian structure, \emph{Charidakos, et al.} (2014) start with the general two--fluid ion and electron action functional, and make all the approximations, changes of variables, and expansions directly within the action variables context. The resulting equations are then mapped to the Eulerian fluid variables using a novel nonlocal Lagrange--Euler map. Using this method, the 
\emph{L\"ust} (1960) general two--fluid model, the extended Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), the Hall--MHD, and the electron MHD model are all derived from a unified theoretical framework. The variational formulation allows the application of the Noether's theorem to derive conserved quantities for each action symmetry of the plasma dynamics.

Extended magnetohydrodynamics is required in many plasma machines. A hollow cathode is the electronic source and neutralizer of the Hall thruster and an ion thruster. When the orbit of an all--electric propulsion satellite changes from $100\,$km to $36000\,$km, the back--pressure changes by two to three orders of magnitude. The influence of the back--pressure on the discharge characteristics of the hollow cathode has been studied experimentally in the so--called diode configuration. With the increase in the back pressure, the anode voltage decreases gradually, and the amplitude of the current oscillation decreases significantly. Additionally, the plasma is relatively stable, the most probable ion energy and the width of the ion energy distribution reduces, and the electron distribution function inclines toward the Maxwell distribution under high back pressure. The analysis results show that the back pressure affects the gas ionization and the ionic acoustic turbulence, which also affects the discharge characteristics of the hollow cathode [\emph{Ning, et al.} (2018)].

%6.1.8
\subsection{Creation of plasma ``blobs'' outside the magnetic separatrix}

Theory for the formation and dynamics of the plasma ``blobs'' opens up the possibility that the SOL plasma profiles can be predicted with greater accuracy. Research on the smaller laboratory machines, including the Helimak and Large Plasma Device (LAPD), indicates that plasma blob filaments contribute to, and in some cases, dominate the plasma profiles. Erosion at the vessel walls competes with emission at the divertor wall in determining the impurity contamination in the plasmas. The SOL plasma plays an important role in impurity erosion and thus the total impurity content of the core plasma. The \emph{Breizman, et al.} (2018) analysis of plasma input shows that during an inductive start--up, there develops a nonmonotonic distribution function in parallel momentum for a group of electrons that are continuously accelerated. The energy gain of these runaway electrons is limited by a combined effect of pitch--angle scattering and synchrotron radiation. The result is a radial transport with high--energy electrons escaping through the magnetic separatrix. This scenario is qualitatively confirmed by the ohmic plasma data in both JET and Tore Supra [\emph{Fontanilla and Breizman} (2017), \emph{Breizman and Aleynikov} (2017)].

%6.1.9
\subsection{Convective transport by intermittent blob--filaments}
%
A plasma blob--filament (or simply a ``blob'') is a localized magnetic field--aligned plasma vortex structure that is considerably denser than the surrounding background plasma and localized in the directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field $B$. In experiments and simulations, these intermittent filaments are often formed near the boundary between open and closed field lines, and seem to arise in theory from the saturation process for the turbulence edge instabilities. Blobs become charge--polarized under the action of an external force which causes unequal drifts on ions and electrons; the resulting polarization--induced $\bm{E\times B}$ drifts move the vortices radially outwards across magnetic separatrix into the Scrape--Off Layer (SOL) plasma of toroidal and in mirror machines (CLM) plasmas.

The blob transport is a general phenomenon occurring in nearly all plasmas outside the closed magnetic flux surfaces. \emph{D'Ippolito, et al.} (2011) review the relationship between the experimental and theoretical results on blob formation, dynamics and transport and assesses the degree to which blob theory and simulations can be compared and validated against experiments. There are numerous publications on the dynamics of the vortices and blobs in the SOL plasma.

A profile for the critical temperature gradient scale length $[L_{T_e}^{-1}=-\nabla T_e/T_e)]$ was extensively measured in L--mode discharges in the Alcator C--Mod tokamak, where electrons were heated by ICRF waves through the minority heating method that produces changes by simultaneously varying heat fluxes and the local temperature gradients. The electron temperature gradient scale length profile was measured via the $B_T$--jog technique [\emph{Houshmandyar, et al.} (2016)] and compared with electron heat flux from power balance analysis using TRANSP. The $T_e$ profiles were shown to be stiff and already at the critical gradient values. The measured $L_{T_e,\rm crit}$ profile is in agreement with ETG turbulence models which predict the dependence of $q/L_{\rm crit}$ on the local $Z_{\rm eff}, T_e/T_i$, and the ratio of the magnetic shear to the safety factor $s/q$. The GENE gyrokinetic simulations confirm that the ETG is the dominant mode of turbulence in the electron scale $(k_\perp\rho_s\gg 1)$. The gradient--turbulence data results agree with results first shown for LHCD--driven $T_e(r, t)$ profiles in Tore Supra in \emph{Horton, et al.} (2000) and \emph{Hoang, et al.} (2003). The results for WEST were subsequently developed in \emph{Horton, et al.} (2017).

An in--depth understanding of the collective modes that can be excited in a wide range of high--energy plasmas is necessary to advance nuclear fusion research in parallel with other fields that include space and astrophysics in particular.  Important achievements are shown to have resulted from implementing programs based on this reality, maintaining a tight connection with different areas of investigations. This involves the undertaking of a plurality of experimental approaches aimed at understanding the physics of fusion burning plasmas.  At present, the most advanced among these is the IGNITOR experiment involving international cooperation, that is designed to investigate burning plasma regimes near ignition for the first time [\emph{Coppi} (2015)]. 

A profile analysis of the L--mode plasmas near the critical electron temperature gradient scale length $L_{\rm crit}$ in the   Alto Campo Toro (Alcator C--Mod) tokamak is carried out  where the electrons were heated by an ion cyclotron range of frequency through a minority--heating method. The analysis was simultaneously varying the heat flux and that continuously changes the local temperature profiles and their gradient scale lengths. The electron temperature gradient scale length $L_{T_e}$ profile was measured via a $B_T$--jog technique [\emph{Houshmandyar, et al.} (2016)] and was compared with electron heat flux measured $T_e$ profiles with a power balance Transport (TRANSP) analysis. The $T_e$ profiles were shown to be stiff and already above the critical gradient values. The profile stiffness was found to be reduced near the $q=1/4$ and 3/2 surface. The measured critical scale length $L_c$ from the $T_e(r)$ profile is shown to be in agreement with Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) model which predict the dependence of $L_c^1$ critical scale length on the dependent on the local $Z_{\rm eff}, T_e/T_i$, and the ratio of the magnetic shear to the safety factor. The results from linear Gyrokinetic Electromagnetic Numerical Experiment (GENE) simulations suggest ETG is the dominant mode of turbulence in the electron scale $(k\rho_s>1)$, and ion temperature gradient/trapped electron mode modes in the ion scale $(k\rho_s<1)$. The measured gradient length $L_c$ profile is in agreement with the profile of ETG critical gradients deduced from GENE simulations.

\subsection{Enhanced confinement properties in H--mode and super--H shots}

Fusion power requires one to maintain the burning plasmas with confinement properties significantly improved over those observed in auxiliary--heated L--mode tokamak discharges in order to achieve the key objectives of fusion plasmas. Thus, we understand the importance of the physics responsible for the favorable trends exhibited, for example, by supershot discharges in TFTR and by the H--mode--type divertor--controlled plasmas. In addressing this general issue, \emph{Tang, et al.} (1989) reports results of theoretical investigations dealing with the onset conditions of the microinstabilities strongly influencing the plasma confinement behavior with gyrokinetic particle simulations interpreted with analytic models for the saturation and transport properties of these instabilities. Comparisons of experimental results with predictions from turbulent transport codes using microinstability--based theoretical formulas for particle, momentum, and energy fluxes must agree with the plasma data.

The theoretical and numerical studies on kinetic microinstabilities, including Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven modes, Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs) in the presence of impurity ions as well as impurity modes (IMs), induced by impurity density gradients, in toroidal magnetized plasmas, such as tokamak and the Reversed--Field Pinch (RFP) are reviewed. The basic theory for IMs, the electrostatic instabilities in tokamak and RFP plasmas, are well developed. The observations of hybrid and coexistence of the instabilities are categorized systematically. The effects of impurity ions on electromagnetic instabilities such as ITG modes, the Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBMs) and kinetic shear Alfv\'en modes induced by impurity ions in tokamak plasmas of finite--$\beta$ ($=$ plasma pressure/magnetic pressure) are important.

Microinstabilities, such as Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven modes and Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs), are widely accepted to be responsible for the anomaly of cross field particle, momentum and energy transports, observed experimentally in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas, and have been under intensive investigation in recent decades [\emph{Horton} (1999), \emph{Tang} (1978), \emph{Liewer} (1985), \emph{Doyle} (2007)]. On the other hand, it is well recognized that (nonhydrogenic) impurity ions are inevitable in toroidal fusion plasmas, owing to unavoidable interactions between plasma and plasma--facing materials such as vacuum vessel and divertor plates. The impurity ions have significant effects on plasma confinement via radiation loss of energy and  the dilution of main fusion ion density. In addition, impurity transport, induced by neoclassical mechanism and turbulence, is important. In particular, turbulent impurity transport, induced by ITG and TEM instabilities, has been studied theoretically and experimentally, and significant progress has been achieved [\emph{Moradi, et al.} (2011, 2012), \emph{Angioni and Peeters} (2006), \emph{Angioni, et al.} (2017a,b), \emph{F\"ul\"op and Nordman} (2009), \emph{Wade, et al.} (2000), \emph{Sertoli, et al.} (2011, 2015), \emph{Futatani, et al.} (2010)]. The isotope effects of the instabilities and transport in the presence of impurity ions have also been investigated by \emph{Dong, et al.} (1994), \emph{Shen, et al.} (2016a,b), \emph{Guo,  et al.} (2017). Impurity effects on residual zonal flow in deuterium--tritium plasmas has been studied [\emph{Guo, et al.} (2017)].

\subsection{Isotope effects on plasma turbulence}

Isotope effects on instabilities driven by Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) and impurities in tokamak plasmas in the presence of tungsten ions are numerically studied [\emph{Shen, et al.} (2018)]. It is revealed that the tungsten ions significantly modify the isotope scaling of the maximum growth rates of the instabilities with respect to the main or effective ion mass number $M_i$ or $M_{\rm eff}[=(1-f_z)M_i+ f_z M_z]$ with $f_z(= Zn_z/n_e)$ being impurity charge concentration. The most reasonable scaling is deduced as $\gamma_{\rm max}=M_{\rm eff}^{-15\pm\beta}$ with $\beta\sim 0.8$, for ITG--driven modes, while $\gamma_{\rm max}=M_i^{-0.4\pm\beta_1}Z_{\rm eff}^{12\pm\beta_2}$ holds with $\beta_1\sim 0.2$, $\beta_2\sim 0.4$ for tungsten impurity modes, in significant contrast with the case of light or intermediate impurities where the scaling is $\gamma_{\rm max}=M_{\rm eff}^{-0.5}$ and $\gamma_{\rm max}=M_i^{=0.5} Z_{\rm eff}^{1.5}$ for ITG and impurity modes, respectively. These results suggest that existence of tungsten impurity would enhance (weaken) the isotope effect of instability driven by ITG (tungsten impurity ions), which is beneficial (harmful) for improvement of confinement when hydrogen isotopes are used in plasmas. The results might also provide hints on studies of particle and energy transports and discharge performance, particularly, in ITER--like wall machines.

The analysis of the influx of impurities from the confinement vessel walls called the ``plasma--facing components'' is described in detail by \emph{Casson, et al.} (2015).

The WEST and the EAST tokamaks create quasi--steady--state high--temperature plasmas that have plasma dust particles from their beryllium, molybdenum and tungsten wall components simulations of the dust transport of these elements explains the observed light emission data. There are experiments in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma Experiments (MDPX) at Auburn University that provide a test bed for dusty plasma transport theory and simulations. The transport of impurities into fusion--grade plasmas with numerous earlier publications on impurity ion transport starting with the TEXT transport experiments [\emph{Horton and Rowan} (1994)].

\subsection{Dust particles in edge plasmas}

Dust particles emitted from the plasma--wall interactions modify the drift waves in the plasma scrape--off layer which then causes some dust particles to again sufficient energy to be injected through the magnetic separatrix into the core plasma. The plasma in contact to the vessel walls produces evaporation and the ejection of ions from the wall into the scrape--off layer plasma. The ions ejected from the walls are often in clumps of about $500\,$nm to 1 micron in size and are called plasma dust particles. These dust particles collect electrons, become negatively charged and gain energy from the electric fields in the edge or Scrape--Off Layer (SOL) plasma. Some of the dust particles are accelerated to high energies and cross the magnetic separatrix into the core plasma.

The dust particles are continuously undergoing a change in their charge 
$Z_de$ due to the interaction with the ionized plasma. The dust particles become highly charged with $Z_d=10^3$ to $10^4$ with a radius $a$ of the space dust particle much less than the Debye length. The radius $a$ of the dust particles range from of order $10\,$nm to $1\,$micron ($=1000$ microns). The charging rate is $dZ_d/dt$ is a function of the electron and ion thermal velocities and the parameter
\begin{equation}
Z=\frac{Z_de^2}{aT_e}.\label{E6.1}
\end{equation}
With the balance for steady state occurring when $Z(t)$ reaches the value
\begin{equation}
\frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{v_{T_e}}=\frac{\omega_{pi}^2}{v_{T_i}}
\frac{T_i}{T_e+Z}.\label{E6.2}
\end{equation}
For $m_i/m_e=1836$ and $T_e=T_i$, the charge balance occurs with 
$Z=2.5$ [\emph{Benkadda, et al.} (1995)]. When the charging rate reaches steady state $dI(Z_d)/dt=0$. The charging rate is approximately given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\delta Z_d}{dt}=-\iota/\chix\delta Z_d\label{E6.3}
\end{equation}
where the rate is given by
\begin{equation}
\nu\chix=\omega_{pi}^2d\frac{(1+\tau+Z)}{\sqrt{(2\pi v_i)}}.\label{E6.4}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Advances in modeling of plasma pedestal behavior and Edge Localized Modes (ELM) control in ITER reference plasma scenarios}

Progress in the modeling of the edge--pedestal plasma behavior in ITER plasmas including linear and nonlinear MHD stability analysis, ELM triggering by pellet injection and vertical plasma oscillations and ELM control by the application of 3D fields is described. These activities are implemented under the framework of ITER Scientist Fellow Network Pedestal Group to improve the understanding of the physics processes that dominate ITER pedestal plasmas thus providing a firmer physics base to evaluate the edge plasma properties in ITER H--mode plasmas and for the physics--based extrapolation of results obtained in present experiments to ITER [\emph{Loarte, et al.} (2018)].

The experimental campaigns of (2016-2019) on JET resulted in a simultaneous extension of density and confinement in ELMy H--mode plasmas using various methods. By further increasing the average triangularity of the plasma, discharges have now been realized with values for $H_{98(y,2)}\ge 1$ and $n/n_{\rm GW}\sim 1.1$, which exceeds what is required for the ITER $Q=10$ standard scenario discovered on JET. The flat--top duration of these discharges is about $5\,$s and is only limited by technical constraints on JET. These high--density, high--confinement discharges exhibit energy losses by other mechanisms than pure ELM activity which points to a possible way of ELM mitigation. High density in high--$\delta$ discharges leads to a reduction in the ELM frequency, which is in contrast to the usual relation between ELM frequency and ELM size. 

Detailed analysis of the ELM behavior and additional thermographic measurements on the divertor targets indicate that there is a window for operation for Type I ELM discharges in ITER. Impurity seeding is an additional tool to mitigate ELMs in discharges with high and low triangularity and has no detrimental effect on energy confinement or neutron production. Pellet injection from the high--field side with a tailored injection rate has produced discharges with high density and high confinement, but more work is needed to optimize the stationarity. Discharges with strong density peaking $(n(0)/n_{\rm ped}\sim 2)$ have been obtained without pellet injection, by careful gas dosing over long time intervals. Density peaking and high--$\beta$ values both favor the destabilization of NTMs due to the associated increased bootstrap current fraction. This can be a limiting factor for the confinement properties of such plasmas, unless care is taken to avoid the creation of large seed islands, induced by large first ELMs or sawteeth, or by varying the ICRH phasing. Confinement studies show an increase of energy confinement with density peaking and triangularity, but still there is a degradation of confinement with increasing Greenwald factor. Density peaking and plasma shaping have a beneficial influence on confinement. Confinement scaling studies with data from He discharges confirmed the mass dependence of the $\rm IPB98(y, 2)$ scaling, and combined with previous T and H studies, suggest $\tau_E\propto M^{0.19}Z^{-0.59}$ Threshold power studies in He show the same dependence on magnetic field, density and mass as for deuterium, but the absolute value is about 50\% higher in He. Extensions of the results to higher currents, fields and heating powers and towards longer flat--top durations on JET are being prepared for ITER. Plasma configurations at high average triangularity have been developed, reducing the disruptive forces of the ITER--like configuration, allowing plasma operation at JET up to $4\,$MA/4$\,$T, in order to study the performance at higher absolute densities and operation closer to $\rho_*^{\rm ITER}$. Such plasmas require at least $25\,$MW of additional heating power to reach the H--mode. 

Various diagnostics have been enhanced to increase the diagnostic capabilities of JET. A inboard pellet track aiming more centrally and allowing higher pellet speeds was installed to further optimize plasma fueling by high--field side pellet injection. Long--pulse scenarios were prepared with a divertor phase of over $50\,$s and with potential for further extensions well over 1 min, giving a new  tool for studies on the stationarity of various plasma parameters and of recycling during long--time intervals.

With its divertor configuration, plasma size, heating, current drive and diagnostic systems, tritium, beryllium and remote--handling capabilities, the JET device accesses a wide range of operating regimes in experimental conditions close to those of a burning plasma experiment. Prior to and during the design phase of ITER, JET produced major contributions to the ITER physics basis [\emph{ITER Physics Basis} (1999)] used to extrapolate plasma performance to ITER. The JET research program has focused on issues critical to finalizing the details of the ITER design.

\subsection{High--pressure relaxed--plasma confinement}

High--pressure plasmas with reversed magnetic fields and nonuniform rotational flows are ubiquitous in nature and are produced in Field--Reversed Confinement (FRC) laboratory plasmas [\emph{Schmitz, et al.} (2016)]. A large toroidal plasma current driven by neutral beam injection and external magnetic field driven by poloidal field coils produce the confinement geometry. 

The Grad--Shafranov equilibria [\emph{Copenhaver} (1983), \emph{Cerfon and Freidberg} (2010)] describe cylindrical magnetic fields from external field coils and toroidal plasma currents [\emph{Schmitz, et al.} (2014, 2016)]. We describe the ion and electron orbits in the geometry of the Norman FRC machine with 12 external coils and the plasma current. Ions are launched from $8\,$NBI injectors at $35\,$KeV for $100\,$msec producing a $T_i\sim 2$-3$\,$KeV and $T_e\sim 500\,$eV plasma. There is sheared $\bm{E\times B}$ flow across the outer closed magnetic field lines. The ion orbits become chaotic in the mirroring region where the radius of curvature is comparable to ion gyroradius. There are ion orbits called the ``butterfly pitch angle'' distributions measured in the magnetosphere and chaotic orbits [\emph{Shibahara, et al.} (2010)]. These orbits affect the drift waves and the Alfv\'en wave stabilization. Analytic theory and 3D computer simulations are used to interpret the results of the measured plasma. A strong radial electric field $E_r(r,\ t)$ develops $\bm{E\times B}$ sheared rotation that suppresses the core turbulence.

Turbulence in the scrape--off layer plasma is modified by the nonlinear transverse cascade. The $p\sim B^2/2\mu_0$ plasma is in a relaxed self--organized state. The turbulence is compared with the density fluctuations measured from X-- and O--mode RF wave field scattering data [\emph{Schmitz, et al.} (2016)].

In space physics the generation mechanism of a butterfly Pitch--Angle Distribution (PAD) of energetic ions is demonstrated by test particle simulations in the stretched magnetic field [\emph{Shibahara, et al.} (2010)]. Polar satellites detect some events from the butterfly PADs of the energetic protons $\gtsim 80\,$KeV in the outer ring current region around midnight near the equatorial plane. They were observed at a relatively disturbed time in the inner magnetosphere and the ring current is developed; that is, where the magnitude of the magnetic field at the Polar satellite was highly depressed and the adiabaticity of the protons were expected to be violated. To reproduce the butterfly pitch--angle distribution, a test particle simulation in which the first adiabatic invariant 
$\mu$ can be monitored are performed. When the radius of the field line becomes comparable to the Larmor radius of a proton, the protons have significant scattering of pitch angle 
$(\alpha)$ due to change of $\mu$. This $\mu$--scattering process reforms the PADs. Owing to cumulative $\mu$--scattering, the flux of the protons have a peak at $\alpha\sim 40^\circ$ (or $140^\circ$) and collapses at $\alpha\sim 0^\circ$ (or $180^\circ$) and $90^\circ$, which produces butterfly PAD distribution. The computed PAD resembles the butterfly PADs observed by the Polar satellite [\emph{Shibahara, et al.} (2010)]. The nonadiabatic effect is important for not only the generation mechanisms of the butterfly PAD but also for the development of the storm--time ring current.

In the 2004 shutdown, a new in--port ICRF antenna was installed on JET with the aim to validate key elements of the ITER--ICRF design. JET diagnostic upgrades included a Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) core and edge, magnetics, bolometry, neutron spectrometry, microwave waveguides and divertor diagnostics. New diagnostics included a high--resolution TS system, TAE active antenna system, wide--angle infrared view, halo sensors, lost 
$\alpha$ particle detectors and a comprehensive system of erosion/re--deposition diagnostics.

JET continues to provide contributions to our understanding of tokamak physics, scaling predictions for ITER, further development of ITER operating scenarios and testing of ITER relevant systems such as heating and current drive, diagnostics and tritium technologies.

The impact of an initial random magnetic field disturbance on the temporal evolution of a two--dimensional incompressible turbulent shearless mixing layer is investigated using direct numerical simulation. Different intensities of the initial random magnetic field are imposed with uniform probability distribution on an identical flow field. The initial flow--field condition is the turbulent shearless mixing layer with different kinetic energy ratios 
and identical integral length scales. Simulations are carried out in a moderate magnetic Reynolds number, which causes a two--way interaction between the velocity and magnetic fields. In order to analyze the effect of the initial random magnetic field on the mixing characteristics, the intermittency inside the mixing layer and the mixing evolution parameters are investigated. With small initial magnetic field intensity, the intermittency occurs in both large and small scales compared to those in hydrodynamic flows. However, increasing the intensity of the initial magnetic field reduces the intermittency in the mixing region to lower values compared to the hydrodynamic flow. The mixing layer growth rate and the mixing efficiency both show reduction by increasing the initial magnetic field intensity, which is attributed to the reduction of the averaged Reynolds number of both homogeneous isotropic turbulent regions due to the suppressing effect of the Lorentz force on the velocity fields of these regions.

Plasma response to three--dimensional Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMP), applied for the purpose of controlling type--I Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) in ITER with the baseline ELM control coils, is computed using a toroidal, resistive, full magnetohydrodynamic model. Considered are five representative ITER plasmas, designed for different phases of the ITER exploration. The plasma response, measured by the plasma boundary corrugation, is found to be similar for the two DT scenarios at full plasma current ($15\,$MA) and full toroidal field $(5.3\,\rm T)$ but different fusion gain factors ($Q=5$ versus $Q=10$), indicating similar ELM control performance with the same RMP coil current configuration. 

The other plasma scenarios, with proportionally scaled down plasma current and toroidal field, can have different plasma boundary corrugation. The key plasma parameter affecting the response is the plasma toroidal flow near the pedestal region, which significantly varies depending on the transport model assumption for the toroidal momentum. Lower pedestal flow leads to a stronger edge peeling response from the plasma and thus a better ELM control. The optimal coil configuration for controlling type--I ELMs is similar for all four ITER plasmas with similar safety factor but different current levels, but is significantly different for the case at half plasma current ($7.5\,$MA) and full field ($5.3\,$T). On the other hand, for the purpose of controlling the radial profile of the plasma toroidal rotation in ITER using 3D fields, the relative amplitude of the toroidal torque density, between the plasma core and edge region, is optimized. Generally, a strong coupling between the core and edge torques is observed, largely due to the middle row of the ELM control coils. The best decoupling scheme of the core--edge torque distribution is to de--emphasize the role of the middle row coils. Optimal coil current configurations are found for the ITER $15\,$MA/$5.3\,$T with $Q=10$ plasma, that synergistically maximize the plasma edge--peeling response (indication for good ELM control) and the toroidal torque near the plasma edge (good for RMP field penetration through pedestal) [\emph{Li, et al.} (2019)].

The effect of Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMP) on boundary turbulence and transport in J--TEXT plasma was experimentally investigated. Edge plasma fluctuations in discharges with and without the $(m/n=3/1)$ RMP currents are diagnosed by using Langmuir probe arrays and that fluctuations in the edge and Scrape--Off Layer (SOL) regions decrease with the application of a $6\,$kA RMP. The broadband turbulence at the radial location of $\rho\sim 0.9$ which has a characteristic frequency of 40-$150\,$kHz was strongly suppressed when applying RMP, as was the radial turbulent particle flux and blob transport in the near--SOL region. These experimental findings make RMP a promising method of suppressing and controlling turbulence and particle transport in a plasma boundary [\emph{Wu, et al.} (2019)].

The ITER Scientist Fellow Network Pedestal Group has made significant progress in understanding of the physics processes that determine pedestal plasma behavior in ITER plasmas, their MHD stability and instability leading to ELMs as well as of ELM control has taken place by the modeling activities implemented under. New nonlinear MHD simulations show that ITER pedestal plasmas have the required characteristics to access the Quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) regime without ELMs by destabilization and saturation of low--$n$ kink--peeling modes, although it is not yet clear if the rotational shear required to stabilize higher--$n$ ballooning modes can be provided by the joint application of the NBI torque and the breaking torque provided by 3D fields from the in--vessel ELM control coils. Controlled ELM triggering has been further assessed for two schemes: pellet injection and vertical plasma position oscillations. For pellet triggering, it has been found that the proximity of the pedestal pressure to MHD stability limits plays an important role in determining the pellet size required to trigger an ELM (which is favorable regarding the optimization of plasma performance and minimizing fuel throughput for ELM control).

The required pellet sizes to trigger ELMs at lower plasma currents are much lower than for $15\,$MA plasmas, particularly at high $q_{95}$. This ensures that this scheme can be explored in the initial H--mode operational phases of the ITER Research Plan at lower plasma currents so that a decision can be taken regarding its applicability for high $Q/I_p$ operation in ITER, which may require an upgrade of the pellet injection system from 4 to 6 injectors. Regarding vertical plasma oscillations, the nonlinear MHD simulations have given the physics basis to evaluate this scheme for ELM control in ITER and confirmed that pellet injection (tungsten ion W) can be used for currents up to $7.5\,$MA as backup when the other ITER ELM control schemes (ELM control by 3D fields and by pellet pacing) are being developed and tested.

The main objective of the IGNITOR Program is to explore the ignition conditions of magnetically confined D--T plasmas while producing significant amounts of fusion power up to about $100\,$MW. For this, a compact, high--field device has been designed that advances the line of high--field experiments which began with the Alcator program at MIT and was later also developed in Italy with the FT program. A relatively short but complete description and analysis of the machine core (see Figs.~\ref{F6.5} and \ref{F6.6}) has been given in \emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013).
%

A detailed design of all the main machine components has been carried out and its results and drawings are now ready to be transferred to the industrial groups that have been identified as capable of constructing all the components of the machine core. The IGNITOR facility is expected to be operated at the Troitsk site of Rosatom and managed by the IGNIR collaboration between Italy and Russia. At this time the IGNITOR Program is the only one that has retained the objective of investigating this approach and the access to ignition conditions thanks to the regular updates of the machine design that have followed relevant advances in physics, technology and materials. The main machine parameters are included in Table~\ref{Tab 6.1} [\emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013)].

A major effort in the machine design has been that of producing a plasma column in which a high mean poloidal field $\overline B_p\simeq\sqrt{10}\,$T can be reached together with plasma currents $I_p\simeq 10$-$11\,$MA while maintaining reasonable safety factors against the onset of macroscopic instabilities (i.e. $q(\psi_a)\simeq 3.6$). The rough arguments for this choice of objectives are as follows: High values of the confinement parameter $n\tau_E, n$ being the particle density and $\tau_E$ the energy replacement time, should be reached considering that the maximum particle density should be related to the average current density $\langle J_\|\rangle\sim\overline B_p/\overline a$, where $\overline a$ is the mean plasma minor radius, and that the confinement time should have a significant dependence on $I_p$. Then the maximum values of $n\tau_E$ should be related to $\overline B_p^2$ as $I_p\simeq 5\overline a\overline B_p$. Moreover, if we consider the mean plasma pressure to be limited by the magnetic pressure $\overline B_p^2/(2\mu_0)$, the plasma reactivity represented by $n^2\langle\sigma_fv\rangle\propto n^2T^2$ can be expected to be related to $\overline B_p^4$. These considerations have in fact been supported by sophisticated numerical simulations that have been carried out by $1+1/2\mathrm{D}$ transport codes [\emph{Coppi, et al.} (2010, 2013), \emph{Airoldi and Cenacchi} (1997)]. In this connection we observe that well--confined plasmas with maximum densities close to 
$10^{21}\,\rm m^{-3}$ have been obtained repeatedly by the Alcator line of experiments and, with lower temperatures, by the Large Helical Device machine. To facilitate the attainment of these densities, the adoption, as in the case of the Alcator C experiments, of a pellet injector is planned. In the case of IGNITOR, however, the required pellet speeds are considerably higher and further advances (expected to be possible) in the technology of these injectors are needed.

An important additional criterion that has driven the IGNITOR design process is that of having a strong Ohmic heating that would persist up to temperatures where $\alpha$--particle heating can take over. Thus the need for an auxiliary heating system (ICRH is the only feasible option) is minimized together with the deterioration of the energy confinement time that has to be dealt with when Ohmic heating ceases to be significant. Assuming that the loop voltage is about constant, as has been observed experimentally until now, the best criterion to be followed in order to have a strong Ohmic heating rate is to have a major radius with the lowest possible values. An essential requirement to achieve ignition condition is the degree of plasma purity that has to be high as discussed in \emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013). This restricts the spectrum of plasma regimes with which IGNITOR has to operate in order to fulfill its main objectives. Therefore while following the progress made in analyzing various transport regimes the main attention remains devoted to the high density L--regime discovered originally by Alcator that can be reliably obtained and to the I--regime that continues to be the subject of a series of investigations whose results are promising. In both regimes the observed degrees of purity are well within the limits required for ignition.

A key structural solution that has made the present design of the IGNITOR machine possible, that combines a remarkably low major radius and the ability to produce plasma currents up to 10-$11\,$MA with realistic degrees of stability, is the mechanical collaboration between the central solenoid and the toroidal magnet. This is the so--called ``bucking and wedging'' of the toroidal magnet coils for their inner vertical legs that are subjected to a radial electromagnetic force toward the (vertical) axis of symmetry. Considering a cross--section on the equatorial plane, with the bucking (against the central solenoid) and wedging solution the coils are subjected to compressional forces both in the radial and tangential directions shown in Fig.~\ref{buck}.

The toroidal magnet system is subdivided into 12 sectors in Fig.~\ref{buck}. Each sector contains 20 coils. The outer supporting structure consists of the so--called C--clamps surrounding the toroidal coils with exception of their vertical leg. The total current in the toroidal magnet is $87.12\,\rm MA\dashv$ turn and corresponds to a current of  $363\,$kA in each turn.

The plasma chamber in Fig.~\ref{F6.8} is a demanding system to design as it has multiple functions, has to operate under different and extreme conditions and most important has to withstand the forces associated with macroscopic disruptions of the plasma column. Figure~\ref{F6.8} shows from the top view the compact design of IGNITOR with the twelve sectors at six unions.

In fact, the evaluation of both these forces and of the number of the disruptions that can take place during the expected lifetime of the machine is subject to relatively large uncertainties. The thick plasma chamber as designed (with a varying mantle thickness from 2.6 to $5.2\,$cm) can withstand a limited number of large disruptions that, taking into account the success achieved (in particular by the DIII--D machine) in preventing the development of disruptions at their onset by appropriate feedback systems, can be considered as realistic. The plasma chamber is mechanically supported by the C--clamps and provides the mechanical support for the Molybdenum tiles (actually, a variety of relevant materials is being constantly examined for these) that are in contact with the plasma. As indicated later, the replacement of the tiles during the operating phase of the machine is carried out by a dedicated robotic system.

Given the importance of avoiding stress concentrations and considering other adopted machine design criteria, a great deal of attention has been devoted to preparing a detailed procedure for the various phases of assembly of the machine and for the welding of the plasma chamber. Two important phases are: i) the joining of $30^\circ$ adjacent sectors, whose main components are a sector of the plasma chamber and the corresponding toroidal field coils and C--clamps package, until a $180^\circ$ ``super sector'' is completed. This phase is to be carried out in a specifically equipped site away from the site in which the machine has to be operated; ii) the joining the two $180^\circ$ super sectors that involves carrying out the final two weldings of the plasma chamber remotely by an appropriate robotic system. Following this joining, the high precision mechanical coupling process of the toroidal magnet with the central solenoid can be undertaken. 

The equipment for the assembly of the machine in its different phases has been designed adopting solutions that permit the handling of the heavy machine components with relative ease shown in Fig.~\ref{F6.9}a,b. TIG welding with and without filler material is envisioned to join adjacent sectors of the plasma chamber and to be carried out from the outside.

\subsection{Robotics criteria}

Robotics is a fundamental element in the construction and operation of the machine: it plays a key role in two phases of the machine life: during its construction, for the closing of the plasma chamber, and during the phase in which experiments are carried out for maintenance operations. Given the different functions and constraints in either case robotics system with different characteristics of operation will be adopted.

During the final machine assembly the closing of the plasma chamber can be performed only using a robot capable of operating through a narrow vertical opening (a diagnostics port) and of performing the delicate welding of the two $180^\circ$ sectors of the machine. The robot will have to be sufficiently rigid to support the welding equipment and will have to be coupled to sensors and instruments in order to follow the welding path with great accuracy. This is an absolute necessity in order to guarantee the correct positioning of the welding structure and the execution of a weld of the highest quality.

During the operation of IGNITOR a robot with many degrees of freedom will ensure all forms of ordinary and out of the ordinary maintenance, allowing the substitution of damaged antennae and tiles. The robot will have to be able to operate within the plasma chamber through a relatively narrow access port and its path needs to extend through the entire plasma chamber. The robot will carry a ``wrist'' with 3 degrees of freedom and one or more dedicated grippers that would allow it to perform a sensored and adaptive grip. This is needed in order to secure and unsecure critical elements of the machine structure.

\subsection{Nonlinear feedback control simulations with 3D structures and disruption studies}

The nonlinear plasma evolution in presence of conductors is a complex event, which requires in principle extremely detailed models to be developed. Presently, several modeling approaches are available for the analysis of the electromagnetic interaction between the plasma and the conductors [\emph{Albanese and Villone} (1998), \emph{Portone, et al.} (2008), \emph{Czarny and Huijsmans} (2008), \emph{Villone, et al.} (2010)]. However, none of them can be applied to all cases of interest, due to specific limitations and ranges of applicability. In particular, codes solving linearized plasma equations are conveniently used in the feedback controller design. However, they cannot analyze a nonlinear plasma evolution characterized by large displacements and/or a wide excursion of the relevant plasma parameters. To this purpose, a new computational tool has been developed (CarMaONL [\emph{Czarny and Huijsmans} (2008)]), that can describe the nonlinear evolution of axisymmetric plasmas through equilibrium points, in the presence of three--dimensional conducting structures. This allows an electromagnetic self--consistent treatment of plasma evolution during the events for which the usual linearized approximation may be no longer valid. The formulation is in the stream of the CarMa code [\emph{Czarney and Huijsmans} (2008)], using a coupling surface to describe the electromagnetic interaction between the plasma and the conductors. The mathematical model and the numerical formulation is presented in \emph{Villone, et al.} (2013). In particular, the 3D passive structures are efficiently modeled by the integral formulation of \emph{Villone, et al.} (2013). The results of the analysis made for IGNITOR by means of a dedicated upgrade of CarMaONL are presented, including the position--shape current--integrated feedback controller inside the code [\emph{Albanese and Rubinacci} (1988)].

As a reference $11\,$MA scenario we describe the equilibrium configuration is characterized by a plasma current $I_p=11\,$MA, poloidal beta $\beta_p=0.203$, internal inductance $l_i=0.818$, radial position of the current centroid $R_C=1.299\,$m. The plasma region is discretized with a 2D triangular mesh made of 5704 nodes, which coincides with the number of nonlinear equations solved at each time step; the trace of the coupling surface $\partial\Omega$ is a line made of a set of 309 edges of such triangles, just inside the vacuum chamber.

The plasma configurations and current densities in 3D structures at two times are described in \emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013). 
The \emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013) simulations predict the plasma disruption features and the evaluation of the EM loads associated with these events are well controlled in the machine operation scenarios and the design of in--vessel components as the EM loads produced by these events are by far the largest among those that in--vessel components must withstand. On the basis of experimental data from existing machines, the range of expected variation of the main parameters characterizing disruptions is estimated. That is, the thermal and current quench time, the evolution of plasma current ($\widehat A$ and $l_i$), the safety factor limits, the halo current fraction and the radiated heat fraction. The MAXFEA axisymmetric 2D MHD code has been used to evaluate the effects, on the induced currents and the EM loads, of variations of the disruption parameters.

\subsection{Anomalous transport processes including self--organization for fusion burning regimes in IGNITOR}

The most advanced scenario of operation for the IGNITOR experiment refers to a toroidal field on axis $B_T\approx 13\,$T and $I_p\approx 11\,$MA [see \emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013)]. A special version of the JETTO equilibrium transport code [\emph{Airoldi and Cenacchi} (1997)] was developed for the analysis of the plasma regimes to be produced by IGNITOR and employed by considering thermal transport coefficients that include (``profile consistency'' [\emph{Coppi} (1980)] criteria and constraints. Then the results (in particular, density and temperature profiles) obtained by applying different models of the electron thermal diffusion have been compared with each other. In these models the ion thermal diffusion is assumed to be represented by a collisional (neoclassical) coefficient, increased by a fraction of the electron diffusion. The first considered model assumes the \emph{Coppi and Mazzucato} (1979) diffusion coefficient to which an appropriate fraction of a coefficient associated with the excitation of the ubiquitous modes [\emph{Coppi, et al.} (1992)] is added.

By operating at optimized plasma parameters $(\langle n_e\rangle\approx 4.7\times 10^{20}\,\rm m^{-3}$,\ $\langle Z_{\rm eff}\rangle\approx 1.2)$ ignition is achieved shortly after the end of the current ramp (at $t=4.75\,$s, where the end of current ramp occurs at $t=4\,$s). Similar optimized plasma parameters, by using a mixed Bohm--gyroBohm model, lead to obtain a delay of ignition by $\approx 1.2\,$s. The poloidal beta is $\beta_p\approx 0.2$ in both cases.

More recently the so--called ``Coppi--Tang'' model, used to predict plasma profiles and parameters for the ITER experiment [\emph{Casper, et al.} (2010)] was applied. In this case ignition is achieved at $t=4.5\,$s and the ``safety factor'' $q(\psi)$ remains well over unity in the central part of the plasma column. In the following Fig.~\ref{F6.10} the obtained energy confinement times are compared to the ITER97L scaling.

\subsubsection{Tri--dimensional structures of the thermonuclear instability and control by ICRH}

A surprising result of the most recent theory [\emph{Coppi} (2014)] of the thermonuclear instability that can take place in D--T plasmas close to ignition is that this develops with tri--dimensional structures emerging from an axisymmetric toroidal confinement configurations. These are helical filaments that are localized radially around a given rational magnetic surface [\emph{Coppi} (2014)]. Until now well known analyses of the fusion burning process of magnetically confined plasmas have been carried out by $1+\frac{1}{2}\,$D transport codes. Therefore new analyses, drastically different from the one performed as a first approach to the problem and described in the following, will have to be developed.

The ICRH system is to be used as an independent means to control the plasma temperature, to accelerate the achievement of ignition in the extended first wall configuration with $B_T=13\,{\rm T}$ with $I_p=10-11\,$MA, and to facilitate the transition to the I--regime in the double X--point plasma configuration ($B_T=9-13\,$T with $I_p=6-10\,$MA). The thermonuclear instability develops at ignition with high--peak densities $(n_0\cong 10^{21}\rm m^{-3})$ , and relatively low temperatures when the complete self--heating of the plasma by the fusion--produced $\alpha$--particles takes over. This can lead to an increase of its plasma pressure. Then, internal plasma modes may be excited and saturate the thermonuclear instability at acceptable levels without external intervention.

In the case where an internal process may not be effective, a scenario is considered whereby IGNITOR is led to operate in a slightly subcritical regime, i.e. the plasma parameters are so chosen that the thermonuclear heating power is slightly less than the power lost, and a small fraction of $^3$He is added to the optimal Deuterium--Tritium mixture. The difference between power lost and heating is compensated by additional ICR heating that should be able to energize the minority species (minority ion heating scheme) directly, which transfers the power to the main plasma species by collisions.

\subsubsection{H--regime with reduced machine parameters: zero--dimensional model analysis}

While making extensive use of the JETTO code, we have developed an improved zero--dimensional code solving the relevant thermal energy balance equations, and used it at first for the analysis of operation scenarios in the H--regime at reduced parameters ($B_T=8\,$T, $I_p=5\,$MA) referring to a double--null configuration (geometry of the last closed magnetic surface with two X--points) and plasma profiles with pedestals at the edge. Access to the H--regime requires an input power $P_{in}=P_{\rm ohm}+P_{\rm ICRF}+P_\alpha$ higher than a threshold value $P_{\rm thr}$ for which the expression given by the latest multi--machine ITPA scaling law, $P_{\rm thr,08}$ [\emph{Martin, et al.} (2008)], is employed. This condition sets a lower limit in terms of input power on the operating window available. An upper limit is set by the maximum power that the ICRF system can deliver, which is about $P_{\rm ICRF}\approx 10\,$MW at the reduced resonant frequency for operation at $B_T=8\,$T. We then find that a somehow limited operating window exists for values of the fusion gain parameter up to $Q\approx 1$; typical values for the central electron density and temperature are $n_{e0}\approx 3.4\times 10^{20}\,\rm m^{-3}$ and  $T_{e0}\approx 10.7\,$KeV respectively. A wider window of operation is obtained if the threshold power for accessing the H--regime is lower than that predicted by $P_{\rm thr, 08}$ [\emph{Martin, et al.} (2008)]. Recent experiments on JET [\emph{Maggi, et al.} (2014)] with a new metallic beryllium/tungsten wall have shown a significant reduction of $P_{\rm thr}$ and how this effect is correlated with low values of  $Z_{\rm eff}$. A reduction of $P_{\rm eff}$ may then be expected also for IGNITOR, that is designed to operate at low values of $Z_{\rm eff}$.

\subsubsection{ICRH and dedicated diagnostics systems}

ICRH system injecting power in the frequency range 80 to $115\,$MHz is designed to accelerate the plasma ignition and facilitate the access to high confinement regimes such as the H and I regimes. The reference plant configuration of the system is shown in Fig.~\ref{F6.10} and the following operation scenarios have been considered: a) $115\,$MHz: $13\,$T, $11\,$MA full performance scenario; b) $80\,$MHz, $9\,$T, 6-$7\,$MA reduced performance scenario.

In order to have high flexibility of operation and to optimize the launch of the RF power into the plasma, the RF system has been conceived with a modular configuration, with each module based on $4\,$RF generators capable to operate in the frequency range indicated above.

Note that: i) the $80\,$MHz; is the central frequency of the selected generators and around this value the max power obtained by each unit is $2\,$MW; ii) the $115\,$MHz; this frequency is located at the upper side of the generators bandwidth and, consequently, the generated power drops down to $1\,$MW per unit.

The Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH)  System is based on 2 modules with the following main characteristics: $N^\circ$ of Generators 8; $N^\circ$ of Antennas 4; Frequency Range (MHz): $80\div 115$; Generated RF Power (MW): $16\div 8$; RF Power at the Plasma $12.8\div 6.4$; Pulse Length $(\sec):4$; Duty Factor: 1/200; Type of Generators: Cavity Coupled RF Tetrode; Type of Antenna: 4 Current Strap.

One of the most critical issue of the system is the safe transfer of the power to the plasma in presence of vacuum and high VSWR. For this reason the max electrical field in the vacuum region of the transmission line and straps has been limited at $5\,$kV/cm with the consequent limitation of the power per strap at $400\,$kW. This value nicely fits the RF generated power in the full performance regime ($13\,$T, $11\,$MA, $115\,$MHz, $8\,$MW at the generators). In the reduced performance regime ($9\,$T, 6-$7\,$MA, $80\,$MHz, $16\,$MW at the generators) the availability of the generated power will allow an increase the power per strap up to $800\,$kW through proper RF conditioning in the critical regions. A full size prototype of the Vacuum Transmission Line (VTL), placed between the port flange and antenna straps, has been manufactured and electrically tested; high voltage tests, at different vacuum and voltage conditions, have been carried out to check the electrical capability of the system with respect to the high voltage $(12\,$kV) and electric field $(5\,$kV/cm), associated with the RF Power and the strong Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of the plasma. A precise guiding system of the rigid coaxial cables and an innovative quick latching system have been verified and a perfect fitting with the Beryllium copper (BeCu) spring electrical contacts has been obtained.\\

\noindent {\bf 3. Dedicated diagnostics systems}\\

The Second Harmonic Interferometer (SHI) [\emph{Brandi and Giammanco} (2007)] is developed and used for the interferometric measurements of the plasma density which is not sensitive to vibrations and mechanical noise. The SHI is composed of two optical units externally connected through optical fibers and the laser, the detectors and all the electronics can be placed in a separated, shielded room. The positioning of the different harmonic chords is essential so as to ensure that the whole machine is monitored. The SHI includes a section for the measurement of the Faraday rotation along the same path of the integrated electron density measurement.

The plasma ion temperature is evaluated through high--resolution spectroscopy, by measuring the Doppler broadening of the impurities atomic lines (usually O--IV or O--V). The low concentration of impurities expected in the machine does not present an insurmountable problem for the current diagnostics technology.

\section{Superconducting Components of the IGNITOR Machine}

Intermediate temperature superconducting cables have been adopted for the largest poloidal field coils of IGNITOR. The MgB2 strands by Columbus Superconductors [\emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013)] can achieve the target specifications for the considered vertical coils, with about 5 meters of outer diameter and maximum field on the conductor $<5\,$T. The cable design includes about $300\,$MgB2 multifilamentary strands of $1\,$mm in diameter and a copper tube for the He--gas flow in the center. Significant improvements in the design and electrical properties allow higher critical current densities and better current sharing properties between the different strands than previously reported.

\section{Dynamics of Geomagnetic Storms and Substorms with the WINDMI Model}

Potential and critical issues are the basis of a comprehensive D-$^3$He fueled FRC reactor design called ``ARTEMIS" (after Apollo's sister in Greek), which offers an attractive prospect of fusion power development for the 21st century. The ARTEMIS fusion reactor is inherently safe and environmentally acceptable in view of the low radioactivity and fuel resources. Furthermore, the estimated cost of electricity is relatively low compared to a light water reactor. An experimental research program needed to develop the D-$^3$He fueled FRC fusion reactors is discussed by \emph{Momota and Tomita} (1992). Magnetic reconnection is a common mechanism or phenomena in space plasmas, such as coronal mass ejections and magnetospheric substorms and also a mechanism of confinement degradation due to violation of magnetic surfaces in magnetically--confined plasmas [\emph{Biskamp} (2000), \emph{Drake} (2001), \emph{Yamada, et al.} (2010)].

\section{Impure Modes in Auroral Plasma Called Auroral Beads}

Auroral beads indicate that shear--flow interchange instability in nightside magnetotail triggers substorm onset 
\emph{Derr, et al.} (2019). A geometric wedge model of the near--earth nightside plasma sheet is used to derive a wave equation for long--wavelength buoyancy waves which transmit $\bm{E\times B}$ sheared zonal flows along magnetic flux tubes. Discrepancies with the wave equation result in \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2015) for shear--flow ballooning instability are discussed. The shear--flow interchange instability is responsible for substorm onset. The wedge wave equation is used to compute dispersion relations and growth rates in the midnight region of the nightside magnetotail around 9-$12\,$RE where the instability develops for comparison with the growth rates of auroral beads characteristic of geomagnetic substorm onset. Stability analysis is performed for the shear--flow interchange modes, and a brief discussion of nonlinearity follows.

\subsection{Analysis of the bimodal nature of solar wind --- magnetosphere coupling}

Early analysis of auroral substorm and storm data was based on the linear prediction filter relating the solar wind electric field and the geomagnetic activity defined by the AL index. The data was both bimodal and dependent on the level of the magnetosphere activity. Early studies truncated the prediction filter to a five--parameter model containing two low--pass--filtered delta functions of arbitrary amplitude and delay time. Subsequent analysis by \emph{Smith and Horton} (1998) on the nature of the bimodal response developed the five--parameter model to quantify the effects of the level of geomagnetic activity on each of the modes of the filter. All levels of activity, the second mode, occurring at $\sim 1$ hour, is relatively unchanged. The first mode, however, has a one--parameter dependence on the level of activity in the magnetosphere. The amplitude of the first mode was shown to increase with respect to activity, and this dependence is sufficient to characterize the changing properties of the magnetosphere with respect to the level of the solar wind activity.

A low--dimensional plasma physics nonlinear dynamical model of the coupled magnetosphere--ionosphere system, called the Real--Time Solar Wind Magnetosphere--Ionosphere System (WINDMI), is able to predict AL and Dst values approximately one hour before geomagnetic substorm and storm events. Subsequently, the 10--min ground--based measurements compiled by World Data Center, Kyoto, are compared with model predictions (\url{http://orion.ph.utexas.edu/!windmi/realtime/}). WINDMI model runs are also available at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (\url{http://ccmc. gsfc. nasa.gov}). The performance of the Real--Time WINDMI model is quantitatively evaluated for 22 storm/substorm event predictions from February 2006 to August 2008. Three possible input solar wind--magnetosphere coupling functions are used in WINDMI: (i) the standard rectified coupling function, (ii) a function due to Siscoe, and (iii) a function due to Newell. Model AL and Dst predictions are validated using the Average Relative Variance (ARV), Correlation Coefficient (COR), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The Newell input function yields the best model AL predictions by all three measures (mean ARV, COR, and RMSE), followed by the rectified, then Siscoe input functions. Model AL predictions correlate at least 1 standard deviation better with the AL index data than a direct correlation between the input coupling functions and the AL index. The mean $D_{st}$ ARV results show better prediction performance for the rectified input than the Siscoe and Newell inputs. The mean $D_{st}$ COR and RMSE measures do not clearly distinguish between the three input coupling functions.

\section{Solar Plasma Winds Drive Magnetic Reconnection with the Earth's Magnetic Field}

The structure of magnetic field surrounding the Earth is determined by the direction and strength of plasma from the Sun that flows over the Earth. Other planets with strong magnetic field fields --- particularly Jupiter and Saturn also have large complex plasma structures with similar features; however the structure of the Earth's magnetosphere is known in much more detail due to the decades of spacecraft missions that have measured the plasma particle distributions and the magnetic field structures over the regions from where solar wind plasma dominates, through the magnetic pause or transition layer into the magnetosphere, where the dipolar magnetic field dominates. The transition layers are complex and particularly important both for weather, defense and history of the life on the planet Earth.

While the dipole magnetic field of the Earth created by currents in the core of the planet give a strong field that has reversed several times over the 4.5 billion years of the planets life, the source field is well approximated as a constant dipolar magnetic field structure with horizontal magnetic field likes in the equator. The latitude and longitude where the field lines are horizontal is defined as the magnetic equator.  For example, Brazil, in South America is near the magnetic equator as opposed to Canada and Norway, where the field lines are nearly vertical. Plasma flows freely along the magnetic flux tubes that connect these regions from the southern to northern hemispheres.  Dipolar magnetic field is the first approximation in the planet's magnetic field that confines the particles, as in the laboratory magnetic mirror machines described in the \emph{FusionPedia Mirror Plasma Confinement}. The observations of the light emitted by hot magnetic ionospheric plasma particles ionizing the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the atmosphere was first measured and explained by  XXX in 190X.

\subsection{Magnetic reconnection of the solar wind plasma with magnetic field of the planet Earth}

As described in Chapters 1--4 of \emph{Turbulent Transport in Magnetized Plasmas} [\emph{W. Horton}, 2nd Edition, 2018, ISBN 978-981-3225-88-6]  plasmas in magnetic fields merge in complex dynamics where the self--consistent dynamics of the ions, electrons in the plasmas respond to and create electric currents that form the self--consistent magnetized plasmas we measure both in the laboratory and in space and astrophysical plasmas. From 190X the existence and measurements of the ionized molecules in the Sun and in the upper region of the Earth's atmosphere was recognized and measured. The dynamics is combination of that of the electric and magnetic fields form Maxwell's equations and the motion of the charged particles (electrons relative to the ions or ionized atoms) that creates the electric currents in the gas. In the 20$^{th}$ Century the combination of electrical engineering and computer technology give rise to the construction of compact spacecraft that measure the planetary, solar and interstellar plasmas with precision. The recent examples are the Voyager I and Voyager II spacecraft that left Earth's magnetosphere in 1976, traveled past Jupiter and Saturn in 1995 and gave the first data on the boundary between the Sun's plasma and the interstellar plasma in 2019. Precision measurements of the Earth plasma are developed by both NASA and by the military owing to the importance of weather and military defense measurements of the magnetosphere and ionosphere plasmas. The Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC is an international leader in the space plasma physics.
 
An overview of the extensive international collaboration of current solar wind plasma driving the Earths magnetospheric plasmas creating solar wind--driven storms and substorms that disrupt the communication and navigational systems is given by the ten authors in the
\emph{Journal of Geophysical Research} \url{https://doi.org/10.1002/2014/A019879} entitled ``Structure of a reconnection layer poleward of the cusp: Extreme density asymmetry and a guide field" which starts with a figure showing measurements for plasma density, ion and electron temperatures, velocities and pressures with the simultaneously--measured three components of the vector magnetic field taken from the WIND spacecraft during the magnetospheric storm on April 11, 1997. The storm was driven by a Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) from the Sun a day earlier.

The ejections of solar plasmas are a major cause of national security and weather changes on the Earth and monitored by ground based and satellite systems by nations around the Earth. A small fraction of the GNSS system from GPS, GLONASS, Bedieu and Galileo is shared to form the guidance signals for cars and aircraft guidance around the world.
 
Voyager I spacecraft gave detailed measurements of the magnetosphere of our largest planet Jupiter showing a structure similar to that of the Earth's magnetosphere, but more complex due to the plasma emitted from a volcano on one of the four large planets discovered by Galileo with his telescope in 1609.  Callisto has volcanoes that emit ionized sulphur and the sulphur plasma is used to study the dynamics of the huge magnetosphere along with the Great Red Spot dynamics on its surface. The planets discovered and measured with some accuracy in location are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. The Great Red Spot ---large plasma vortex and the Galilean moons are shown in Fig.~\ref{4moons}. Europa, the smallest of the four moons, is about the size of Earth's moon. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system. The image of Callisto is from the 1979 flyby of NASA's Voyager I spacecraft.

The dynamics of the electrons in the outer radiation becomes relativistic during periods of enhanced solar activity as described in \emph{Mays, et al.} (2007)  and the textbooks of L. Lyons and xxx.  Enhanced periods of solar wind create relativistic electron populations that disrupt global communications systems. 

\subsection{Radial response of outer radiation belt relativistic electrons during enhancement events at geostationary orbit}

During the periods of enhanced solar plasma activity, the Earth's magnetosphere traps relativistic electrons and this produces severe disruptions of the global navigational systems signals.  The plasma regions of the geostationary orbit  characterized by enhancements at GEO generally penetrate to $L=5.0$ but at lower $L$ they may respond differently and even be seen as depletions. Geomagnetic indices, especially AE and $D_{\rm st}$ are used to predict and determine the lowest $L$--shell $L= 5R_E$ show plasma enhancements and depletions. 

\subsection{Spatial distribution of the eddy diffusion coefficients in the plasma sheet during quiet time and substorms from THEMIS satellite data}

The THEMIS satellite performed turbulent important analysis of the formation of quasi-stable plasma sheet configurations in the magnetosphere. The turbulence provides a self--consistent the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere that includes the plasma sheet stability. The turbulence is important for an understanding of the location of an isolated substorm expansion phase onset. The level of turbulence has been evaluated by calculating the eddy diffusion coefficients using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions from Substorms satellite data. It was found that the value of the eddy diffusion coefficients may vary by 3 orders of magnitude, generally ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6\rm km^2/s$, increasing with the distance from the Earth. The area of low eddy diffusion coefficients, less than $10^4\rm km^2$/s, is situated at distances below $12\,R_E$ in the tail where there is a transition region between the dipole and the tail-like geomagnetic field configuration. This region is consistent with the location of isolated substorms mapping the first auroral arc brightening situated at the equatorial edge of the auroral oval into the magnetosphere [\emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2011)].

The data shows that plasmas can demonstrate very complex behavior that includes multiscale dynamics, emergence and self--organization, phase transitions, and  turbulence with spatiotemporal chaos [\emph{Lu} (1995), \emph{Carreras, et al.} (1996), \emph{Valdivia, et al.} (1996, 2003, 2005, 2006), \emph{Biskamp} (2000), \emph{Klimas, et al.} (2000, 2010) ,\emph{Uritsky, et al.} (2007)]. 

The magnetosphere is formed as a result of the interaction between the solar wind supersonic and super-Alfv\'enic turbulent flow and the geomagnetic field. This interaction creates plasma turbulence in various regions of the magnetosphere, and in particular in its tail. There is a significant difference between a fluid turbulent wake behind an ordinary obstacle and the geomagnetic tail. The cross--section radius of the ordinary wake is close to that of the obstacle, while the magnetotail plasma separates into the plasma sheet and the plasma tail lobes. A number of studies have shown that turbulent processes in the plasma sheet are important for the understanding of this dynamics [\emph{Antonova} (1985), \emph{Angelopoulos, et al.} (1992, 1993); \emph{Borovsky, et al.} (1997), \emph{Ohtani, et al.} (1998)]. As evidences of turbulence in the plasma sheet, it is possible to mention the ``sky images" of near--Earth space plasma, showing the presence of multiple structures moving with different, and sometimes very large, velocities [\emph{Chamberlain} (1961)]; or the presence of strong fluctuations in the electric fields at the auroral field lines measured by Viking, Freja, Fast, and Interkosmos--Bulgaria--1300 satellites [\emph{Maynard, et al.} (1982), \emph{Mozer, et al.} (1980), \emph{Weimer, et al.} (1985), \emph{Stepanova, et al.}, (2003a)]. A clear manifestation of the existence of low--frequency magnetospheric turbulence was also obtained through analysis of fluctuations of geomagnetic indices [\emph{Takalo, et al.} (1993), \emph{Consolini and De Michelis} (1998), \emph{Uritsky and Pudovkin} (1998), \emph{Hnat, et al.} (2002), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2003b, 2005a), \emph{Pulkkinen, et al.} (2006), \emph{Wanliss and Uritsky} (2010)], auroral absorption [\emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2005b, 2006)], and Polar UVI images [\emph{Uritsky, et al.} (2008)]. Measurements of the particle fluxes inside the plasma sheet allowed to study the fluctuations in the plasma bulk velocity and show that these fluctuations exceed significantly their average values [see \emph{Baumjohann, et al.} (1990), \emph{Angelopoulos, et al.} (1992, 1993, 1996, 1999), \emph{Borovsky, et al.} (1997, 1998), \emph{Borovsky and Funsten} (2003a, 2003b), \emph{Borovsky and Gary} (2009), \emph{Ovchinnikov, et al.} (2000), \emph{Troshichev, et al.} (2002), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2005c, 2009)]. Despite differences in time resolution, the behavior of different components of the bulk velocity fluctuations is very similar, except for the bursty bulk flow events (BBFs), which produce asymmetry in the probability density function of the X and Y components of the inner plasma sheet flows in the GSE/GSM coordinate system. According to \emph{Baumjohann, et al.} (1990), \emph{Angelopoulos, et al.} (1992, 1993, 1996, 1999), and \emph{Borodkova} [2002], when BBFs are removed from the plasma sheet observational database, the plasma flow has an average convection that is small and a variance that is many times larger than its average. 

The existence of this turbulence provides a self--consistent approach to study the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere, including the plasma sheet stability and the location of the expansion onset of isolated substorms [\emph{Antonova and Ovchinnikov} (1996, 1999), \emph{Antonova, et al.} (1998), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2002, 2005c, 2009)]. For example, on the average, the magnitude of the plasma bulk velocity in the magnetosphere of the Earth is smaller than the Alfv\'en and sound speeds. So the condition of magnetostatic equilibrium (forces connected to the existence of plasma pressure gradients are compensated by the Amperes force) is generally fulfilled.  Along this line, \emph{Antonova and Ovchinnikov} (1996, 1999, 2001) proposed that a stable turbulent plasma sheet can be formed when the regular plasma transport, produced by the dawn--dusk electric field across the plasma sheet, is compensated by the eddy diffusion turbulent transport across it. They consider that the plasma particle flux is equal to $S = n_hV_i-D_{rn}$, where $n$ is the average of the turbulent plasma particle density fluctuation, $hV_i$ is the averaged bulk velocity, and, $D$ is an eddy diffusion coefficient. When the turbulent fluctuations act to expand the plasma sheet, the large--scale electrostatic dawn-dusk electric field tries to compress the sheet. When the expansion and compression compensate each other, a stationary structure is formed. This assumption allows to predict the order of magnitude of the eddy diffusion coefficient in the $Z$--direction $10^5\rm  km^2/s$, that is necessary to reproduce the observed plasma sheet thickness. This value agrees with the estimated eddy diffusion coefficients, obtained from measurements by the ISEE--2, Interball--Tail, and GEOTAIL satellites 
[\emph{Borovsky, et al.} (1997, 1998), \emph{Borovsky and Funsten} (2003b), \emph{Ovchinnikov, et al.} (2000), \emph{Troshichev, et al.} (2002), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2005c, 2009)]. Furthermore, the eddy diffusion transport in the plasma sheet is affected by the location inside the plasma sheet, the geomagnetic activity, and the solar wind parameters [\emph{Ovchinnikov, et al.} (2000), \emph{Neagu, et al.} (2002, 2005), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2005c, 2009), \emph{Nagata, et al.} (2008), \emph{Wang, et al.} (2010)]. 
The nature of the observed turbulence is still not clear since there is a number of physical processes leading to the turbulence generation which depend on both the spatially and temporal scales. \emph{Antonova, et al. } (1998), \emph{Luizar, et al.} (2000), and \emph{Antonova} (2002) suggested that plasma pressure gradients are the most probable candidates for the generation of large-- and medium--scale harmonics of the magnetospheric turbulence. There are also indications that the level of magnetic turbulence in the magnetotail correlates with the level of the velocity perturbations and particle beams  which dramatically increase with the flow velocity. Therefore, shear flows and particle beams are also premiere candidates for the generation of turbulence [\emph{Bauer, et al.} (1995), \emph{Voros, et al.} (2004)]. 

Even though the plasma sheet appears to be a dynamic and turbulent region [\emph{Borovsky, et al.} (1997), \emph{Ohtani, et al.} (1998)], the substorm cycle seems coherent and repeatable with identifiable distinct phases [\emph{Baker, et al.} (1999)] and predictable geomagnetic indices [\emph{Vassiliadis, et al.} (1995), \emph{Valdivia, et al.} (1996, 1999)]. It has been suggested that the resolution to these seemingly contradicting observations should be through the understanding of the process of self--organization in plasmas [\emph{Chang} (1999), \emph{Uritsky and Pudovkin} (1998), \emph{Valdivia, et al.} (2005, 2006), \emph{Uritsky, et al.} (2009a)]. The possibility of an inverse turbulent cascade has been discussed by \emph{Uritsky, et al.} (2001) and \emph{Rosa, et al.} (1998). Furthermore, the interaction between different harmonics of the magnetospheric turbulence is not well explored. A number of works indicate that the turbulence in the plasma sheet has an intermittent character [\emph{Angelopoulos, et al.} (1999), \emph{Consolini and De Michelis} (1998), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2003b, 2006), \emph{Arancibia Riveros, et al.} (2008)]. A very interesting approach to explain the processes leading to the formation of the spectrum of magnetospheric turbulence, including the self--consistent influence of geomagnetic substorms and storms, is the concept of the self--organized criticality [\emph{Chang} (1999), \emph{Uritsky and Pudovkin} (1998), 
\emph{Klimas, et al.} (2000), \emph{Valdivia, et al.} (2003, 2005, 2006), \emph{Uritsky, et al.} (2007, 2009b)]. 

The THEMIS satellite data gives the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms for the different phases of isolated magnetospheric substorms.

The plasma instrument data Analysis THEMIS was acquired in the plasma sheet. The time intervals were selected for the moments of the ion distribution functions obtained from the onboard moments calculations of the Electrostatic Analyzer (ESA) in the energy range from $25\,$eV to $25\,$KeV and Solid State Telescopes in the energy range from $25\,$KeV to $6\,$MeV [\emph{McFadden, et al.} (2008), \emph{Angelopoulos} (2008)]. The geomagnetic field measurements were provided by the Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) [\emph{Auster, et al.} (2008)], which were used for the calculation of the plasma $b$ parameter. In order to compare the previous results of \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2009)], using the Interball--Tail satellite, the selected intervals were for plasmas with number density $n \ge 0.1\,\rm cm^{-3}$, and ion temperature $T \ge 1\,$KeV. The satellite $Z$ coordinate is between -8$\,R_E$ and 8$\,R_E$, with $b \ge 1$, to ensure that the satellite is located in the plasma sheet. The $X$ and $Y$ coordinate of the satellites are shown in Figure~3. 

Figure~\ref{1THEME} shows an example of the data from THEMIS C satellite on 26 February 2008. It can be seen, that the satellite was not always located inside the plasma sheet, and the combination of criteria $n \ge 0.1\,\rm cm^{-3}$ (not shown in Figure 1), $T\ge 1\,$KeV, and $b\ge 1$ is sufficiently robust to ensure the location of the satellite inside the plasma sheet Figure~\ref{2THEME}.

The turbulent transport is inferred from the eddy diffusion coefficient tensor $D$ required to describe the plasma transport produced by the turbulent convection vortexes in the diffusion approximation. This  $D$ tensor  is very important for the understanding of the plasma sheet stability through the relation $S = nhV_i - D_{rn}$. 

From the THEMIS data we can construct three components of the bulk velocity $V_a(i)$ in the GSM coordinate system with a time resolution of 3 seconds according to the probe spin time. If we take two of such components, for example $a$ and $b$, the autocorrelation function was calculated.

The data was separated into 12 min intervals, that contain $N = 240$ bulk velocity data points. Adjacent intervals overlap for half of their length (6 min), and we use the center of the interval to mark the time. The autocorrelation time (tab) was determined as the best fit to the natural logarithm of the autocorrelation function by the linear expression $y = 1 - ax$, using only one parameter of fitting. Figure~\ref{2THEME} shows an example of the bulk velocity $V_z$ and the corresponding autocorrelation function with the respective fit. Three methods were used to estimate the autocorrelation time. The first method finds the value $t_0$ at which the logarithm of the autocorrelation function goes through zero. The second method uses the value $t_{\rm min}$ where the autocorrelation function has its first minimum and fits the value of tab using all the points between $0\le t\le t_{\rm min}$. In the third method, uses the value $t_e$ where the autocorrelation function goes below $e^{-1}$ and fits tab using the points between $0\le t\le t_e$. With these three values of tab an average value of tab is derived as shown in Fig.~\ref{2THEME}.

Similarly, the mean square (rms) speed during the chosen time interval is determined from the value of the slope of the AL index was $s\ge {1\over 2}\,\rm nT/min$ for 5 min with respect to the middle point of the interval, and $s > 0$ for 20 min with respect to the middle point of the interval. In this study the authors could not distinguish the data corresponding to the growth phase, as it was difficult to establish a clear criterion for automatic data extraction.  To analyze the spatial distribution of the eddy diffusion coefficients the $X$-$Y$ GSM plane was partitioned into 30 overlapping bins between 6 and $30\,R_E$ into the tail, and between $-p/4$ and $p/4$, having midnight as 0, in the azimuthal direction. Each bin has an extension of 6 RE in the radial direction and $p/12$ in the azimuthal direction. Each next bin overlaps with the previous one for half step size ($3\,R_E$ and $p/24$). This was done to improve the statistics so that each bin has at least 10 measurements of the eddy diffusion coefficients, which permits a smooth final distribution. The number of eddy diffusion coefficients measurements found in each bin is shown in Figure 3d, for each of the three different phases of isolated substorms. 

Figure~3  shows the spatial distribution of diagonal terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient tensor in GSM coordinate system during the three different phases of isolated substorms considered in the analysis. While the values of the coefficients vary significantly, the analysis shows that on average all the diagonal terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient tensor increase with distance in the tail under all geomagnetic conditions. Furthermore, we have in general $D_{xx} > D_{yy}, D_{zz}$, as can be seen by comparing Figure~3  (left), 3 (middle), and 3 (right), as the eddy diffusion in $X$ direction could be affected by the propagation of the Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) studied by \emph{Baumjohann, et al.} (1990) and \emph{Angelopoulos, et al.} (1992). Let us note that the values of the eddy diffusion coefficients obtained here are similar to the typically values reported for the plasma sheet. 

Finally, the eddy diffusion coefficient is obtained from: 

Let us note that following this procedure makes it possible to estimate all components of the eddy diffusion coefficient tensor in the GSM basis, but for the purpose of the present manuscript we will only analyze the diagonal terms $D_{xx}, D_{yy}$ and $D_{zz}$. 

With the three values for $t$, we can also estimate a deviation $s_t$, defined by half the difference between their minimum and maximum values. If this deviation is larger than 50\% of the average value of $t$, we do not consider the interval in our analysis. It is important to mention that we also eliminate from the analysis the intervals that have small autocorrelation time ($t < 10\,$s) and large autocorrelation time ($t > 300\,$s). Exclusion large autocorrelation times partially removes the coherent flows. 

To determine whether the eddy diffusion coefficient is taken during the quiet time, expansion, or recovery phase of the substorm, we perform an analysis of the 1 min resolution Auroral Low (AL) index. The interval was considered as quiet when $\rm AL \ge -100\,nT$ and the absolute value of the slope $s$ of the AL index was $|s|\le {1\over 2}\,$nT/min for 40 min before and after the middle of the interval. The interval was considered as expansion when $\rm AL < -100\,$nT and the value of the slope of the AL index was $s = -{1\over 2}\,$nT/min for 5 min with respect to the middle point of the interval, and $s < 0$ for 20 min with respect to the middle point of the interval. The interval was considered as recovery when $\rm AL < -100\,$nT and $V_{\rm rms}$; ${1\over4} N\partial 4p \partial 5p V^2$ (rms; $D^{1\over 4}_2$.

\caption{Shown here is the variation of eddy diffusion coefficient with the distance from the Earth, obtained by averaging the bins showed in Figure~3  by the angle. We can see that in general all the diagonal components of the eddy diffusion coefficient tensor tend to increase with distance from the Earth, especially during the expansion and recovery phases of substorms. There seem to be a saturation at around 10-$15\,R_E$, which could be related to the change from dipole to tail field. Unfortunately, the THEMIS mission does not account for a satellite at distances larger than $30\,R_E$, so that we can only assume that this saturation effect continues, but we cannot be certain.}

We note that during substorms all three diagonal components, $D_{XX}, D_{YY}$, and $D_{ZZ}$, experience a significant increase with respect to the quiet times. There is a local maximum at a distance of $\sim 22\,R_E$, that deserves further study. 

There is a clear dawn--dusk asymmetry in all three diagonal elements of D, as can be seen in Figure 3. This effect occurs for all phases, but it is more significant during the recovery phase. It is also interesting to note that at around $X = -20\,R_E$ and $Y = -10\,R_E$ there is a local decrease in all three diagonal components, which may be related to the low statistics seen in Figure~3d. 

\section{Conclusions}

Analysis of bulk velocity fluctuations obtained from THEMIS satellite mission allowed the  derivation of the spatial distribution of the values of eddy diffusion coefficients for different phases of geomagnetic substorms and during quiet time inside the plasma sheet for all components of the bulk velocity. Obtained $D_{YY}$ and $D_{zz}$ distributions are similar to ones reported by \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2009) using the Interball--Tail data. Nevertheless, better sampling of the bulk velocity allowed to detect new features in the behavior and distribution of the eddy diffusion coefficients and, unlike the Interball--Tail satellite, to study the eddy diffusion in the $X$ direction. The THEMIS data allowed the identification of quiet time intervals and the corresponding the expansion and recovery phases of the substorms. Eddy diffusion coefficients obtained for quiet geomagnetic conditions are close to those obtained by \emph{Nagata, et al.} (2008) and \emph{Wang, et al.} (2010).
 
The research showed that the values of eddy diffusion coefficients vary significantly, increasing on average in the tailward direction, especially during disturbed geomagnetic conditions. Furthermore, the values of the diagonal terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient tensor seem to saturate for large values of $-X$. This variation can reflect the transition from the region where the presence of the dipole geomagnetic field is still relevant, to the region where the geomagnetic field has a pure tail configuration. 

The values of the eddy diffusion coefficients in $Z$ direction were similar to those predicted by \emph{Antonova and Ovchinnikov} (1996, 1999, 2001). According to this research, a compact and comparatively stable turbulent plasma sheet can be formed when the plasma variation of the eddy diffusion coefficients for (a) quiet, (b) expansion, and (c) recovery time intervals. $D_{XX}$ (black circles), $D_{YY}$ (white squares), and $D_{ZZ}$ (black diamonds) are given. 

Transport, produced by the dawn-dusk electric field across the plasma sheet, is compensated by the eddy diffusion turbulent transport. When the turbulent fluctuations act to expand the plasma sheet, the large--scale electrostatic dawn--dusk electric field counteracts to compress the plasma, similarly to the case of the laboratory plasma pinch which is compressed by the induction electric field. When the expansion and compression compensate each other, a stationary structure is formed. 

It is necessary to stress that the existence of turbulence in the Earth's magnetosphere is quite natural, taking into consideration that the solar wind plasma flowing around the Earth has high fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers. In such a case a turbulent wake is expected to be formed. 

The increase in the values of diffusion coefficients with the distance in the tailward direction also can help to explain why the substorm onset takes place deeply inside the magnetosphere, as confirmed by many authors [see, e.g., \emph{Samson, et al.} (1992a, 1992b), \emph{Frank and Sigwarth} (2000), \emph{Lyons, et al.} (2002), \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2002), \emph{Yahnin, et al.} (2002), \emph{Dubyagin, et al.} (2003), \emph{Antonova, et al.} (2009)], because only the region which was stable before the onset of the substorm expansion phase can become unstable. 

There is a broad spectrum of plasma instabilities which could lead to such a substorm development (see, for example, the discussion by \emph{Stepanova, et al.} (2002, 2004) and \emph{Lui, et al.} (2008) and \emph{Antonova } (2004) for a review). 

Nevertheless, the interplay between the turbulent processes in the plasma sheet and the geomagnetic sub- storms is not clear. It is necessary to concentrate a significant effort in understanding the processes involved for different time and space scales. 

The solar wind increases from the sun toward the heliosphere as given approximately by the isothermal expansion due to the rapid electron thermal transport. The speed and Mach numbers are roughly (i) at the Earth $400\,$km/s with $M_s = 4$, and (ii) at Jupiter $800\,$km/s with $M_s = 8$. Jupiter's magnetic moment $M_J = 2\times 10^4 M_E$ with $R_{mp}\simeq 45 R_J = 3\times 10^6$/km where $R_J = 7.1\times 10^4$km. The Earth's magnetic moment is $M_E = 8\times 10^{15} T.m^3$. Jupiter has a high level of relativistic electrons (flux $ > 10^6\rm cm^{-2} s^{-1}$) up to $20\,$MeV in energy. There is strong decimeter wavelength synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere of Jupiter [\emph{Dessler} (1983)].

%The following data was moved to Chapter 1 some time ago, so is not used here now.

%Exploring the Solar System with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
%Voyager 2 crossed into interstellar space a year ago. Now, five teams of astronomers have analyzed the data it returned to paint a picture of this boundary in the outer solar system. 
%Four decades after its launch into the outer solar system, Voyager 2 crossed the boundary that separates the Suns domain from the stuff that floats between the stars. Its crossing on November 5, 2018 happened six years after that of the speedier Voyager 1.
%Voyager 1 returned a surprisingly messy view of this outer boundary. In fact, astronomers had a hard time figuring out when the spacecraft had actually made the crossing. Now, Voyager 2 promises a point of comparison. In a dedicated issue of Nature Astronomy, astronomers analyze its report from the frontier.
%Far from the Sun
%One could argue that neither Voyager has really left the solar system. For example, the Suns gravity holds the hypothesized shell of icy objects known as the Oort Cloud in orbit at a distance of some 100,000 astronomical units (a.u., the average distance between Earth and the Sun)  far beyond the Voyagers. What the two spacecraft have left behind, however, is the heliosphere, the cavity around the Sun blown out by the solar wind.
% 
%This illustration shows the position of NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes outside of the heliosphere. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause, or the edge of the heliosphere, in August 2012. Heading in a different direction, Voyager 2 crossed another part of the heliopause in November 2018. The lines mark the direction of plasma flow both inside and outside the heliopause. Solar plasma flows in a different direction than the interstellar plasma (NASA/JPL-Caltech).
%Even though the Sun is pouring out charged particles into this bubble, the density of those particles decreases as the square of their distance from the Sun. By the edge of the heliosphere, matter has become incredibly sparse, a mere 0.002 electrons per cubic centimeter, as Donald Gurnett and William Kurth (both at University of Iowa) report in their study of Voyager 2 data. These particles havent lost their energy, though, and they remain very hot.
%The gas and dust between the stars, on the other hand, is cold and dense. The particles of the interstellar medium, and the magnetic fields they carry, sweep around the heliosphere like ocean waves around a boat. The boundary between the two, known as the heliopause, is by its nature unstable. It breathes, expanding when the Sun is more magnetically active and shrinking when the Sun goes quiet.
%Wherever the boundary is, scientists expect it to be marked by the same changes: a jump in particle density and a drop in temperature. Thats what they were looking for as the Voyagers traveled farther and farther from the Sun.
%A Journey Outward
% 
%Artist's concept of the Voyager spacecraft design (NASA/JPL-Caltech).
%The Voyagers launched a few weeks apart in 1977 for a grand tour of the outer solar system. Because its traveling faster, Voyager 1 reached the heliopause first, speeding through the boundary in the northern hemisphere. However, its plasma instrument failed in 1980, so scientists had to analyze data from its other instruments to get readings on what particles in its vicinity were doing. While Voyager 1 reached the edge of the solar bubble on August 25, 2012, scientists didnt fully realize it until after the fact.
%What made the matter more confusing was that scientists had expected the direction of the magnetic field to change abruptly as Voyager 1 traversed from one particle bath to another. But Voyager 1 saw no change. Was it simply a coincidence that the magnetic field from inside the bubble, which comes from the Sun, had lined up just right with the one from outside the bubble, which comes from the stars?
%
%Voyager 2's View of the Heliopause
%Like Voyager 1, Voyager 2 crossed the nose of the heliosphere  that is, into the flow of interstellar plasma, though Voyager 2 passed through the southern hemisphere. But unlike Voyager 1, Voyager 2 has five working instruments, including the plasma instrument that failed on Voyager 1. This instruments reading of a 20-fold jump in density is what confirmed that Voyager 2 had gone beyond the heliopause. The change occurred over only 0.005 a.u.
% 
%Particle number densities versus radial distance from the Sun in astronomical units (AU). Black dots and lines are from Voyager 1 (V1) and red dots and lines are from Voyager 2 (V2). Densities from plasma oscillations are electron densities from the plasma wave instrument (PWS). Densities from the PLS (plasma) instrument are proton densities, which are almost the same as the electron densities (Don Gurnett/University of Iowa).
%Another marker of the heliopause is a sudden change in the nature of the energetic particles. The energies of solar wind particles pale in comparison to those coming from the galaxy at large. As Voyager 2 crossed through the heliopause, it saw the low-energy ions from the solar wind drop away, replaced by galactic cosmic rays produced in distant and long-ago supernova explosions.
%However, Voyager 2 saw no sudden shift in magnetic field accompanying the changes in particle density  a strike against Voyager 1s observations being due to chance. We can dismiss this as a coincidence in one case, but we cannot do that twice, says Leonard Burlaga (NASA Goddard), study lead and coinvestigator on the Voyagers plasma and magnetic field experiments. There must be some physical process thats coordinating the magnetic field across this region. That process is not understood.
%What was also surprising was that both spacecraft had crossed the heliopause at roughly the same distance from the Sun: 121.6 and 119 a.u., respectively. Voyager 1 made its move as the Sun was nearing a peak in activity, sending out regular explosions of plasma and energy known as coronal mass ejections. By the time Voyager 2 went across, though, the Sun's had quieted. The heliopause should have breathed in during this time, yet both spacecraft went over the boundary at roughly the same distance. If we take our models at face value, we'd expect a difference, Burlaga says.
%
%Density measurements show that both spacecraft crossed the heliopause in under a day, yet neither one saw a whole boundary. Voyager 1 saw the outside leaking in, says Edward Stone (NASA-JPL), Voyagers project scientist and lead of another study: Even before we left the heliosphere, we had two episodes where we were connected to the outside. The interstellar medium had penetrated the heliopause in these instances and invaded the heliosphere.
%For Voyager 2, Stone says, the situation was reversed. Even after its heliopause crossing, the spacecraft was still detecting particles originating in the solar wind. This time, the inside was leaking out.
%Observations from both craft continue to reveal the full complexity of the heliopause. Voyager 1 saw a stagnation region before the heliopause, where particle velocities dropped near zero, but Voyager 2 didnt see anything like that. Instead, Voyager 2 saw multiple boundary layers inside the heliopause. Both spacecraft saw a boundary layer extending at least 10 a.u. past the heliopause, a region that Gurnett likened to the boundary layer that forms when air flows over an airplane wing.

%Next up, technically speaking, is the bow wave that forms ahead of the heliosphere as it travels through the interstellar medium, like the bow wave that forms at the prow of a ship. Depending on how fast the solar system travels relative to the stuff around us, this wave might even be a shock, more akin to the bow shock in front of a fighter jet. Unfortunately, even as the Voyagers continue to zip along at 3 a.u. per year, they wont reach this boundary with working instruments. Stone estimates the Voyagers only have another five years of power left. And theyll be the last probes to pass through these boundaries for at least the next 25 years.
%Instead, Stone says, the goal is to measure the true interstellar medium, the one thats undisturbed by the Sun, its field, and the particles it sends out. We will measure as far from the heliosphere as we can.

%%The Voyager 1 and 2 Saturn encounters occurred nine months apart, in November 1980 and August 1981. Voyager 1 is leaving the solar system. Voyager 2 completed its encounter with Uranus in January 1986 and with Neptune in August 1989, and is now also en route out of the solar system.
%%For the second time in history, a human-made object has reached the space between the stars. NASA's Voyager 2 probe now has exited the heliosphere - the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields created by the Sun.
%%Members of NASA's Voyager team will discuss the findings at a news conference at 11 a.m. EST (8 a.m. PST) today at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington. The news conference will stream live on the agency's website.
%%Comparing data from different instruments aboard the trailblazing spacecraft, mission scientists determined the probe crossed the outer edge of the heliosphere on Nov. 5. This boundary, called the heliopause, is where the tenuous, hot solar wind meets the cold, dense interstellar medium. Its twin, Voyager 1, crossed this boundary in 2012, but Voyager 2 carries a working instrument that will provide first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway into interstellar space. 
%%Voyager 2 now is slightly more than 11 billion miles (18 billion kilometers) from Earth. Mission operators still can communicate with Voyager 2 as it enters this new phase of its journey, but information - moving at the speed of light - takes about 16.5 hours to travel from the spacecraft to Earth. By comparison, light traveling from the Sun takes about eight minutes to reach Earth.

%%"Working on Voyager makes me feel like an explorer, because everything we're seeing is new," said John Richardson, principal investigator for the PLS instrument and a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. "Even though Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause in 2012, it did so at a different place and a different time, and without the PLS data. So we're still seeing things that no one has seen before."
%%In addition to the plasma data, Voyager's science team members have seen evidence from three other onboard instruments - the cosmic ray subsystem, the low energy charged particle instrument and the magnetometer - that is consistent with the conclusion that Voyager 2 has crossed the heliopause. Voyager's team members are eager to continue to study the data from these other onboard instruments to get a clearer picture of the environment through which Voyager 2 is traveling.
%%"There is still a lot to learn about the region of interstellar space immediately beyond the heliopause," said Ed Stone, Voyager project scientist based at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
%%Together, the two Voyagers provide a detailed glimpse of how our heliosphere interacts with the constant interstellar wind flowing from beyond. Their observations complement data from NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), a mission that is remotely sensing that boundary. NASA also is preparing an additional mission - the upcoming Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), due to launch in 2024 - to capitalize on the Voyagers' observations. 
%%"Voyager has a very special place for us in our heliophysics fleet," said Nicola Fox, director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters. "Our studies start at the Sun and extend out to everything the solar wind touches. To have the Voyagers sending back information about the edge of the Sun's influence gives us an unprecedented glimpse of truly uncharted territory."
%%While the probes have left the heliosphere, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have not yet left the solar system, and won't be leaving anytime soon. The boundary of the solar system is considered to be beyond the outer edge of the Oort Cloud, a collection of small objects that are still under the influence of the Sun's gravity. The width of the Oort Cloud is not known precisely, but it is estimated to begin at about 1,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and to extend to about 100,000 AU. One AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth. It will take about 300 years for Voyager 2 to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly 30,000 years to fly beyond it.
%%The Voyager probes are powered using heat from the decay of radioactive material, contained in a device called a radioisotope thermal generator (RTG). The power output of the RTGs diminishes by about four watts per year, which means that various parts of the Voyagers, including the cameras on both spacecraft, have been turned off over time to manage power. 
%%"I think we're all happy and relieved that the Voyager probes have both operated long enough to make it past this milestone," said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. "This is what we've all been waiting for. Now we're looking forward to what we'll be able to learn from having both probes outside the heliopause."
%%Voyager 2 launched in 1977, 16 days before Voyager 1, and both have traveled well beyond their original destinations. The spacecraft were built to last five years and conduct close-up studies of Jupiter and Saturn. However, as the mission continued, additional flybys of the two outermost giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, proved possible. As the spacecraft flew across the solar system, remote-control reprogramming was used to endow the Voyagers with greater capabilities than they possessed when they left Earth. Their two-planet mission became a four-planet mission. Their five-year lifespans have stretched to 41 years, making Voyager 2 NASA's longest running mission. 
%%The Voyager story has impacted not only generations of current and future scientists and engineers, but also Earth's culture, including film, art and music. Each spacecraft carries a Golden Record of Earth sounds, pictures and messages. Since the spacecraft could last billions of years, these circular time capsules could one day be the only traces of human civilization.
%%Voyager's mission controllers communicate with the probes using NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), a global system for communicating with interplanetary spacecraft. The DSN consists of three clusters of antennas inGoldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia. 
%%The Voyager Interstellar Mission is a part of NASA's Heliophysics System Observatory, sponsored by the Heliophysics Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. JPL built and operates the twin Voyager spacecraft. NASA's DSN, managed by JPL, is an international network of antennas that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions and radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the solar system and the universe. The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia's national science agency, operates both the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, part of the DSN, and the Parkes Observatory, which NASA has been using to downlink data from Voyager 2 since Nov. 8.

%%High resolution imaging of inertially confined fusion implosions using Compton radiography Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments aim to impose the highest possible temperatures and pressures on the fusing ions by compressing a spherical ablator and layer of cryogenic deuterium-tritium fuel with the maximum degree of uniformity. Direct and multiple imaging of the ablator and fusing fuel as they go through maximum compression is fundamental to understand the dynamics of the asymmetries and the amount by which they degrade the implosion efficiency. Here we report on the first radiographs of cryogenic indirect drive implosions. We have used pairs of laser-generated, point-projection, backlighters to generate X-rays with energies exceeding 50keV and record two radiographs, spaced in time, of the fuel near stagnation in implosions experiments at the National Ignition Facility. The radiographs, with a spatial and temporal resolution of ?10 m and ?3 ps, respectively, allow measurements of areal mass densities and the reconstruction of the fuel density profiles. We will discuss the direct measurements of fuel non-uniformities resulting from drive asymmetries and hydro-instabilities, peak and areal densities, and kinetic energy, with emphasis on the impact of these parameters on performance.

When the interplanetary magnetic field originating at the sun contains a southward magnetic field component, the solar wind can cause magnetic reconnection on the dayside of the earth, followed by nightside reconnection in the magnetotail ``Interplanetary magnetic field and the auroral zones", n.d). This deposits energy in the magnetotail and disrupts the equatorial current sheet, initiating a sequence events which leads to the formation of aurorae in the E--layer of the ionosphere by accelerating plasma towards the polar regions of the earth [\emph{Coppi, et al.} (1966), \emph{Kivelson and Russell} (1995), \emph{Wolf} (1995), \emph{Angelopoulos, et al.} (2008a,b), \emph{De Zeeuw, et al.} (2004), \emph{Zou, et al.} (2010), \emph{McPherron, et al.} (2011), \emph{Sergeev, et al.} (2011), \emph{Forsyth, et al.} (2014)]. Such a sequence of events is referred to as a magnetic substorm. At the onset of magnetic substorms, the most equator--ward auroral arc suddenly brightens, followed by breakup of the arc and pole--ward expansion [\emph{Akasofu} (1964) \emph{Donovan, et al.} (2008)]. In the minutes leading to the breakup, small periodic fluctuations in the aurora aligned with magnetic longitude form [\emph{Nishimura, et al.} (2014)]. These fluctuations have come to be called (auroral beads Henceforth, ``longitudinal" will be used to refer to magnetic longitude. Auroral beads have been found to be likely pervasive in onset arcs, and the exponential growth of the beads indicates that a plasma instability in the magnetosphere is responsible for substorm onset [\emph{Gallardo--Lacourt, et al.} (2014), \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2017)].

During the last decade, a number of studies have shown that turbulent processes in the plasma sheet are very important for the analysis of the formation of quasi--stable plasma sheet configurations.The existence of this turbulence provides a self--consistent approach to study the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere, including the plasma sheet stability. The turbulence can also be very important for an understanding of the location of an isolated substorm expansion phase onset. In this study the level of turbulence has been evaluated by calculating the eddy diffusion coefficients using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms satellite data. It was found that the value of the eddy diffusion coefficients may vary by at least 3 orders of magnitude, generally ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6 \rm km^2/s$, increasing with the distance from the Earth. The area of low--eddy diffusion coefficients, less than $10^4\rm km^2/s$, is situated at distances below $12\,R_E$ in the tail where we found the transition region between the dipole and the tail--like geomagnetic field configuration. This region is consistent with the location of isolated substorms, as indicated by the first auroral arc brightening situated at the equatorial edge of the auroral oval. 

All--Sky Imagers (ASIs), which are a part of the NASA THEMIS mission to uncover the sequence of events which occur in the first few minutes of substorm onset, are distributed across North America, as seen in Fig.~\quad. They have a $1\,$km spatial resolution, and $3\,$s cadence image capturing capacity, and respond to $557.7\,$nm emissions. This spatio--temporal resolution is succinct to capture the pertinent data for analyzing auroral bead structures for the green emissions corresponding to aurora at an altitude of approximately $110\,$km, namely the E--layer [\emph{Mende, et al.} (2008), \emph{Burch and Angelopoulos} (2008)].

\emph{Motoba, et al.} (2012) used ASI data from auroral beads in the northern and southern hemispheres, and proposed a common magnetospheric driver. Ultra--low frequency waves occurring within minutes of substorm onset are observed in the magnetosphere at frequencies similar to those of the auroral beads, and a single event was analyzed by \emph{Rae, et al.} (2010) to demonstrate that the beading is characteristic of a near--earth magnetospheric instability triggering a current disruption in the central plasma sheet. Of the examined instabilities, cross--field current instability and shear--flow ballooning instability were the only two consistent with the analytical results. \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2015) used the ASI data for substorm events over a 12--hour time span throughout the auroral oval (pre--midnight sector) across Canada and Alaska to perform an optical--statistical analysis that yielded maximum growth rates for the beads as a function of longitudinal wavenumber, which were compared with theoretical calculations for growth rate dependence on wavenumber for various instabilities. Ultimately, the two mechanisms which remained unrefuted were the shear--flow ballooning instability and the cross--field current instability.

Note that wave propagation direction (eastward vs.~westward) differed for the individual substorm events, but growth rates are independent of propagation direction [\emph{Nishimura, et al.} (2016).

Subsequently, \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2015) used the T96 model [\emph{Tsyganenko} (1995, 1996)] to map the wavenumbers back to the equatorial magnetosphere to obtain the corresponding magnetospheric wavenumbers $k_y\epsilon[2.5\times 10^{-6}\,{\rm m}^{-1}$, $3.75\times 10^{-6}{\rm m}^{-1}]$, or wavelength interval $\lambda_\perp\epsilon[1700\,$km, $2500\,$km]. The T96 model underestimates field--line stretching (and spatial scales) during the substorm growth phase, but the error is systematic, so the spatial scales can be compared between events. The arcs map to the equatorial plane mostly in the range of 9-$12\,$RE, with field strengths less than $20\,$nT. The growth rates were normalized so that the spatial scales in the magnetosphere were not an artifact of the T96 mapping. Normalization presupposes that most events were caused by the same instability. If each event was caused by a different instability, normalization would be unjustified.

Of the two instabilities which were not ruled out by the \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2015) analysis, the shear flow ballooning instability provided the best explanation of the observed beading results, corroborating previous findings along these lines [\emph{Friedrich, et al.} (2001)]. This instability was first characterized in \emph{Voronkov, et al.} (1997). This instability is a hybrid of the Kelvin--Helmholtz and Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities with larger growth rates operating on shorter growth time scales than pure Kelvin--Helmholtz instability. The former are driven by shear flows and the latter by earthward pressure gradients. An extensive linear analysis of such hybrid instabilities and their relation to substorms has been conducted by \emph{Yamamoto} (2008, 2009). In particular, it was found that the hybrid waves can grow in the presence of an earthward particle energy density gradient. The auroral arc is tied to the boundary between the stretched field 91 lines and the depolarized field lines at the inner edge of the near--Earth plasma sheet. This is 92 where pressure gradients are most relevant. The spatial scale of the shear flow ballooning instability varies inversely as the size of the shear--flow region. \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2015) determined that for this instability, the growth rates peak at $0.2\,s^{-1}$ in the wavenumber regions specified above.

After setting up a simple geometric wedge model following \emph{Wolf, et al.} (2018) for which perturbations will entail earthward flowing waves which carry the effects of the magnetospheric disturbance back to the ionosphere, we derive a wave equation for the plasma wedge which differs from that of both his original paper [\emph{Wolf, et al.} (2018)], and that from which \emph{Kalmoni, et al.} (2015) extracted the equation governing the shear flow ballooning instability, namely \emph{Voronkov, et al.} (1997). \emph{Voronkov, et al.} (1997) treated the coupling of shear flow and pressure gradient instabilities, but incorrectly perturbed the momentum equation. \emph{Wolf, et al.} (2018), on the other hand, neglected the shear flow effect, thus obtaining low--frequency buoyancy waves which are not coupled to shear flow. Either of these alterations shifts the growth rates and, more importantly, fails to capture some of the essential qualitative features of the instability mechanism.

In summary, it appears that a shear--flow interchange instability in the midnight region of the nightside magnetopause is the more plausible link the causal chain of events which initiate substorm onset via earthward traveling buoyancy waves, and results in the aurorae in the E--layer of the ionosphere. After perturbations drive an instability, the linear equations and dispersion relations become invalid, and the full nonlinear dynamical analysis becomes necessary. This will be the nature of future work on the ballooning interchange dynamics of the flux tubes in the wedge model.

We now eliminate fast modes, assuming $\widetilde\omega^2\ll k_y^2c_f^2$, retaining only those modes which play a substantial role in substorm onset. We also assume that the length scales for $\delta v_r\sim\delta$, but are small compared to $r$ and variations in $P_0, v_0, \rho_0\sim L$ (from which the scale for $B_0$ follows from equilibrium force balance). In short, we assume small shear flow width. Care must be taken to ensure that terms which involve ratios of the small parameters are not hastily dropped.\\

\section{Envisioned High--Field Superconducting Experiments}

An important incentive to undertake the analysis of high field superconducting experiments is the recent realization that ``hybrid'' high--field magnets can be fabricated using two superconducting components: MgB2 for the ``low'' field ($\gtsim 10\,$T) outer part and a high temperature superconductor for the high--field inner part. The advantage of an entirely superconducting machine relative to one like IGNITOR, whose high--field components involve copper magnets, is that the length of the pulse and the duty cycle are not limited by the heating of the coils. For the inner part of the toroidal magnet a helical configuration of the type proposed originally in \emph{Coppi et al.} (1987) can be envisioned. The main function of this is to contribute to magnetic flux variation needed to induce the high toroidal currents ($I_p\gtsim 15\,$MA).

The structural analysis of the IGNITOR machine load assembly has been performed taking into account the friction coefficients at the interfaces between the significant components. The finite element ANSYS model was used to analyze the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the structure. The calculation shows stresses within the allowable limits at the operating temperature. Interlaminar shear stresses values on TFC insulation have been validated by the results of test performed by Ansaldo. Two full size IGNITOR TFC turns have been manufactured by Kabel Metal to qualify the fabrication process and the hardening of the material OFHC. Several samples of the cooling channel were machined to validate the Electron Beam (EB) welding process.

IGNITOR structural analysis show that the structural stability of the Load Assembly is assured also during the worst plasma disruptions. The production of the new turn prototypes has allowed to validate the new design concept and to optimize the process in view of the plate series production. This prototype production has been accomplished under a strict quality assurance in order to identify and record any production aspect that may affect cost and quality.

A qualitative model which includes three loops of zonal flow vs.~turbulence and turbulence vs.~pressure gradient is proposed for the experimentally--observed two types of limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) and low--intermediate--high (L--I--H)  confinement transitions. The experimental evidences supporting the model and revealing the roles of turbulence and pressure--gradient--induced flows in
triggering the H--mode at marginal heating power in tokamak plasmas are presented. The dominant role played by pressure--gradient--induced flows in I--phase of type--J LCO as well as I--H transition is demonstrated, along with that done by the turbulent--Reynolds stress--driven zonal flows in the L--I transition as well as I--phase of type--Y LCO. The trigger and conditions for the I--H transition are identified from the experimental observations.

High--confinement mode is essential for realization of magnetic--confinement nuclear--fusion energy application and study of nonlinear transitions among multi--equilibrium states of complex systems, such as tokamak plasmas [\emph{Wagner, et al.} (1982)]. However, the physics mechanism for low--to--high (L--H) confinement transition is not fully understood and is still a challenge facing the fusion community.

Two kinds of LCOs have been observed on the HL--2A tokamak when the plasma approaches the H--mode. The first one is a correlation between zonal flow and turbulence. The turbulence firstly drives zonal flow, and then the enhanced zonal flow suppresses the turbulence, which is characterized by the clockwise LCO (Y--LCO) with turbulence leading the zonal flow. The second correlation is between turbulence and the shear flow dominated by pressure gradient. The shear flow first enhances and then the turbulence is suppressed, which is characterized by the counterclockwise LCO (Y--LCO) with the shear flow prior to turbulence. The suppressed turbulence can further make edge pressure gradient steeper and then enhance the poloidal flow. This is a positive feedback, which is necessary for triggering the L--I--H transition.

An important issue has been resolved regarding the potential of ELM control for the W (tungsten) exhaust in ITER by modeling the effect on W transport of the nonlinear MHD growth during ELMs. The results have confirmed the initial conjecture that ELMs do not contribute to W exhaust, but rather the opposite, for conditions in which W neoclassical temperature screening dominates at the pedestal between the ELMs. This puts into question the viability of the controlled ELM triggering approach to provide W exhaust over a wide range of ITER H--mode plasmas, particularly those at high $Q/I_p$ for which the separatrix density needs to be high to provide radiative divertor cooling leading to good W screening in the pedestal.

ELMy H--mode experiments at JET in 2000/mid--2002 have focused on discharges with normalized parameters for plasma density, energy confinement and beta similar to those of the ITER $Q_{\rm DT}=10$ reference regime $(n/n_{\rm GW}\sim 0.85$, $H_{98(y,2)}\sim 1$, $\beta_N\sim 1.8)$. ELMy H--mode plasmas have been realized reaching or even exceeding those parameters in steady--state conditions (up to $\sim 5$), $\mathrm{s}$ or $12\tau_E)$ in a reproducible way and only limited by the duration of the additional heating phase. These results have been obtained (a) in highly--triangular plasmas, by increasing the average triangularity $\delta$ towards the ITER reference value $(d\sim 0.5)$ , and (b) in plasmas at low triangularity $(d\sim 0.2)$ by seeding of Ar and placing the 
X--point of the plasma on the top of the septum. Pellet injection from the high--field side is a third method yielding high density and high confinement, albeit not yet under steady--state conditions. In highly--triangular plasmas the influence of input power, plasma triangularity and impurity seeding with noble gases has been studied. Density profile peaking at high densities has been obtained in (a) impurity--seeded low--triangularity discharges, (b) ELMy H--modes with low levels of input power and (c) discharges fueled with pellet injection from the high field side. New ELM behavior has been observed in high--triangularity discharges at high density, opening a possible route to ELM heat--load mitigation, which can be further amplified by Ar impurity seeding. Current extrapolations of the ELM heat load to ITER show a window for Type I ELM operation. Confinement scaling studies indicate an increase in confinement with triangularity and density peaking, and a decrease in confinement with the Greenwald number. In addition, experiments in H isotope and He indicate $\tau_E\propto M^{0.19} Z^{-0.59}$. The threshold power for the LH transition in He plasmas shows the same parametric dependence as in D plasmas, but with a 50\% higher absolute value.

Detailed analysis of the ELM behavior and additional thermographic measurements on the divertor targets indicate that there is a window for operation for Type I ELM discharges in ITER. Impurity seeding is an additional tool to mitigate ELMs in discharges with high and low triangularity and has no detrimental effect on energy confinement or neutron production. Pellet injection from the high--field side with a tailored injection rate has produced discharges with high density and high confinement, but more work is needed to optimize the stationarity. Discharges with strong density peaking $(n(0)/n_{\rm ped}\sim 2)$ have been obtained without pellet injection, by careful gas dosing over long time intervals. Density peaking and high--$\beta$ values both favor the destabilization of NTMs due to the associated increased bootstrap current fraction. This can be a limiting factor for the confinement properties of such plasmas, unless care is taken to avoid the creation of large seed islands, induced by large first ELMs or sawteeth, or by varying the ICRH phasing. Confinement studies show an increase of energy confinement with density peaking and triangularity, but still there is a degradation of confinement with increasing Greenwald factor. Density peaking and plasma shaping have a beneficial influence on confinement. Confinement scaling studies with data from He discharges confirmed the mass dependence of the $\rm IPB98(y, 2)$ scaling, and combined with previous T and H studies, suggest $\tau_E\propto M^{0.19}Z^{-0.59}$ Threshold power studies in He show the same dependence on magnetic field, density and mass as for deuterium, but the absolute value is about 50\% higher in He. Extensions of the results to higher currents, fields and heating powers and towards longer flat--top durations on JET are being prepared for ITER. Plasma configurations at high average triangularity have been developed, reducing the disruptive forces of the ITER--like configuration, allowing plasma operation at JET up to $4\,$MA/4$\,$T, in order to study the performance at higher absolute densities and operation closer to $\rho_*^{\rm ITER}$. Such plasmas require at least $25\,$MW of additional heating power to reach the H--mode.

Various diagnostics have been enhanced to increase the diagnostic capabilities of JET. A inboard pellet track aiming more centrally and allowing higher pellet speeds was installed to further optimize plasma fueling by high--field side pellet injection. Long--pulse scenarios were prepared with a divertor phase of over $50\,$s and with potential for further extensions well over 1 min, giving a new  tool for studies on the stationarity of various plasma parameters and of recycling during long--time intervals.

The main objective of the IGNITOR Program is to explore the ignition conditions of magnetically confined D--T plasmas while producing significant amounts of fusion power up to about $100\,$MW. For this, a compact, high--field device has been designed that advances the line of high--field experiments which began with the Alcator program at MIT and was later also developed in Italy with the FT program. A relatively short but complete description and analysis of the machine core (see Figs.~\ref{F6.5} and \ref{F6.6}) has been given in \emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013).

A detailed design of all the main machine components has been carried out and its results and drawings are now ready to be transferred to the industrial groups that have been identified as capable of constructing all the components of the machine core. The IGNITOR facility is expected to be operated at the Troitsk site of Rosatom and managed by the IGNIR collaboration between Italy and Russia. At this time the IGNITOR Program is the only one that has retained the objective of investigating this approach and the access to ignition conditions thanks to the regular updates of the machine design that have followed relevant advances in physics, technology and materials. The main machine parameters are included in Table~\ref{Tab 6.1} [\emph{Coppi, et al.} (2013)].

\section{Linear Mirror Machines and the Field--Reversed Confinement Machines}

Linear Mirror Machines, as developed at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California and in the Budker Institute in Novosibirsk, have unique properties that are complementary to those of the toroidal plasmas.

A plasma blob--filament (or simply a ``blob'') is a localized magnetic field--aligned plasma vortex structure that is considerably denser than the surrounding background plasma and localized in the directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field $B$. In experiments and simulations, these intermittent filaments are often formed near the boundary between open and closed field lines, and seem to arise in theory from the saturation process for the turbulence edge instabilities. Blobs become charge--polarized under the action of an external force which causes unequal drifts on ions and electrons; the resulting polarization--induced $\bm{E\times B}$ drifts move the vortices radially outwards across magnetic separatrix into the Scrape--Off Layer (SOL) plasma of toroidal and in mirror machines (CLM) plasmas.

High--electron temperatures $T_e$ reduce charge exchange losses and increase fast particle--slowing down time, thereby enhancing the efficiency of plasma heating and current drive. The role of RF electron heating is critical in Fusion Power plasmas. The recent verification of RF heating is in the Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC) plasma, as described in this chapter.

High electron temperature $T_e$ improves plasma confinement and performance. The RF electron heating study produces new insights into the physics underlying effects of unique FRC magnetic configuration.

Plasma is over--dense $(\omega_{pe}>30\omega_{ce})$. The radial profiles of the HHFW heating in the C--2 FRC plasmas are shown in Figs.~\ref{F3.1}--\ref{F3.3} for five frequencies.

For the electron heating in the Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC) in the University of California in Irvine and the TriAlpha Laboratory, the waves are:
\begin{itemize}
\item EBW ($2.45\,$GHz, $5\,$GHz, $8\,$GHz, $18\,$GHz, and $28\,$GHz)
\item  Upper--hybrid resonant frequency ($50\,$GHz, $55\,$GHz)
\item Whistler wave frequency (0.5-$1.0\,$GHz).
\item Landau damping --- the force acting on electrons is $F_{\rm LD}=eE_\|$
\item Transit--Time Magnetic Pumping (TTMP or MP), in which the force is $F_{\rm MP}=-\nabla_\|(\mu B_\|)$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global simulations of the Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC) fusion plasmas}

Global  Particle--In--Cell (PIC) code, called ANC, with electrostatic drift waves is used in simulations of the electron drift wave turbulence in C--2/C--2U plasmas [\emph{Lau, et al.} (2017)]. The simulations show that turbulence grows up in the SOL and then spreads into the core field--reversed region in the nonlinear steady state through an inverse cascade from $k_\phi\rho_s$ from the maximum linear growth rates with toroidal mode numbers of 70 to 75 corresponding to $k_\phi\rho_s\sim 15$ to 20. The turbulence saturates with $k_\phi\rho_s\sim$ 5-10 in the SOL. In the core the spectrum peaks at $k_\phi\rho_s\sim 10$ from nonlinear coupling driven by the high level of turbulence in the scrape--off layer. In the saturated state the turbulence peak shifts from the mid--plane to the mirror regions near $z=+, -2\,$m in the SOL. 

New simulations with nonadiabatic electron dynamics and the Alfv\'en waves active are being performed. The electrostatic drift wave turbulence is consistent with the Doppler Backscatter (DBS) density fluctuation data reported by \emph{Schmitz, et al.} (2016).The fluctuation backscatter diagnostic instrument used to measure the density fluctuations is described in \emph{Schmitz et al.} (2014). The properties of the electrostatic drift waves in the beam driven Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC) are unstable producing a turbulent ion thermal flux. The unstable axial eigenmodes are computed for toroidal mode number $n=20$ axial for four machine lengths ranging from $27R_0$ to $42R_0$ where $R_0=26.8\,$cm is the radius of the central confinement chamber. The $k_\perp\rho_i=2.0$ is fixed and the growth rate frequency normalized to $v_{th,i}/L$ with $L=0.4R_0$. The growth rates range from $0.0022\Omega_{cp}$ to $0.0037\Omega_{cp}$ with even and odd mode symmetries about the center of the mirror chamber. There are flute--like modes with even parity and an odd parity modes with respect to the $z\to-z$ axial reflection symmetry about $z\to-z$. The maximum mode amplitudes occur well outside the SOL separatrix and maximum in mirror region beyond the $B_{\rm max}$ at $Z/R=\pm 10.$

Typical frequency and growth rates are $\omega=-6v_{thi}/L_s$ and $\gamma=1.0$ to 1.2 $v_{vth,i}/L_s$ where $L_s=20R_0$ the length of the field line for a typical mode with $n=20$ corresponding to $k_s\rho_i=0.36$ and $n=20$ and $k_r\rho_i=0.6.$

In the closed magnetic field region the magnetic gradient drift is opposite to the diamagnetic drift direction. Outside the magnetic curvature drift is in the same direction as the diamagnetic drift in the outer mid--plane and opposite the diamagnetic drive in the mirror throats. Contour plots of the eigenmode structures are shown in \emph{Bao, et al.} (2019). The maximum amplitude of the axial wave functions is in the ``bad'' magnetic curvature region in the formation section at $|z|/R_0\gtsim 15$ to 20. The maximum of the wave function is in the two--end formation sections of the long central cell. The formation section is past the end--region mirrors cells and before the divertor end--cell region. The unstable drift waves are only strong in the SOL outside the closed FRC separatrix. The global particle--in--cell code GTC--X with the Alfv\'en wave coupling gives the details of the plasma waves and transport. The ITG mode is stable inside the magnetic separatrix. The linear eigenmode calculations show that the turbulent ion thermal transport is outside the field reversal region.

The impurity effects on Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven instability in Transport Barriers (TBs) are numerically investigated with the gyrokinetic integral eigenmode equations in tokamak plasmas. In particular, the effects of temperature and density gradients of the main ions $(\varepsilon_{T_i}$ and $\varepsilon_{ni})$ are analyzed independently to understand the physical mechanisms better, instead of keeping their ratio $\eta_i=\varepsilon_{ni}/\varepsilon_{T_i}=\,$const as carried out in previous works, when the parameters of impurity ions vary. It is found that the effect of impurity ions with outwardly peaked density profiles on ITG modes depends on the competition between the destabilizing effect of the impurity density gradient $L_{n_z}$ and the stabilizing effect induced by the dilution of main ions from impurity ions when $\varepsilon_{T_i}$ is fixed, which is in contrast with the results for a fixed $\eta_i$. The destabilizing effects include enhancement of ITG modes and coupling to the Impurity Mode (IM) in weak ITGs (big $\varepsilon_{T_i})$ and strong impurity density gradient regimes. In addition, the stability boundaries for ITG modes, including high--order modes, are discussed in detail, and compared with previous works [\emph{Fr\"ojdh, et al.} (1992)]. Furthermore, the impurity ions with either inwardly or slightly outwardly peaked density profiles have weaker and stronger stabilizing effects on small and large poloidal wave vector $k_\theta\rho_s$ modes, respectively. However, the impurity ions with steeper outwardly peaked density profiles have stronger stabilizing effects on large $k_\theta\rho_s$ modes. Moreover, the inwardly--peaked impurity ion density profiles are beneficial for main ion confinement and impurity decumulation, due to the main (impurity) ions flowing inwardly (outwardly). Finally, analyses of eigenmode structure and the quasilinear particle flux are performed in detail. The results show that the gradients of the impurity ions have important effects --- especially on higher--order ITG modes.

\section{Mirror Confinement With Expansion Grids}

Mirror confinement with expansion grids biased to reflect the escaping electrons operates as GDT at Novosibirsk and in the Tri Alpha Company machine in Irvine, California.

Over nearly 20 years, TriAlpha Energy (TAE) has raised over \$500M of private capital, allowing it to pioneer and then refine the FRC approach over a succession of experimental research devices, leading up to the present C--2W experiment, shown in Figure~1. Our long--term computational research goal is to do Whole Device
Modeling, which will combine models working on many scales, with calibration and verification with experimental data from C--2W and its successors. In conjunction with experiments this will lead to a commercial fusion power plant. How quickly this will happen depends, in part on our ability to do ``virtual science". 

The physics that is being studied at Tri Alpha Energy has important relevance for the 
publicly--funded fusion plasma science sector, because many of the concepts are complementary to those being explored in public facilities such as the NSTX--U experiment at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and the GDT experiment at Budker Institute.

\section{Kinetic Simulation of Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC) Stability and Transport}

Magnetic confinement fusion offers the prospect of a carbon--neutral, environmentally responsible and inexhaustible energy source. The present mainline approach to magnetic fusion energy is via the tokamak reactor that relies on a strong toroidal (doughnut--shaped) magnetic field to confine plasma at temperatures characteristic of the interior of stars ($\sim100\,$million$^\circ$K). The hydrogen isotopes deuterium (D) and tritium (T) fuse at these temperatures, releasing energy mainly in the form of neutrons and alpha ($\rm H_e^{++}$). The most advanced tokamak to date, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), is designed to test and demonstrate the sustained production of fusion energy for the first time.

The magnetic field--reversed configuration (FRC) employs its magnetic field more efficiently,
characterized by a much higher ratio $\beta$ of the plasma kinetic pressure to the external magnetic field energy density, with averaged $\beta\sim 0.9$. This magnetic configuration is of great interest as a fusion reactor concept due to its compact, axisymmetric geometry and the potential for aneutronic fusion based on advanced fuels, such as the proton--Boron fusion reaction (p--$B^{11}$). A major advantage of this fuel is that
there are vast quantities of Boron in the US and around the world, in contrast with Tritium, a hydrogen isotope not found naturally on Earth.

Over nearly 20 years, TriAlpha Energy (TAE) has raised over \$500M of private capital, allowing it to pioneer and then refine the FRC approach over a succession of experimental research devices, leading up to the present C--2W experiment, shown in Figure~1. Our long--term computational research goal is to do Whole Device

\subsection{A New Code (ANC) and Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC) codes in context}

The ANC code [\emph{Fulton} (2017)] is a specialization of the Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC) [\emph{Lin, et al.} (1998), \emph{Holod, et al.} (2009)], and is developed in collaboration between Tri Alpha Energy and Professor Zhihong Lin, PI of the Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC) project, at UC Irvine. A New Code (ANC) and Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC) are the first codes that are being used to simulate turbulent transport in the Field--Reversed Configuration (FRC).  GTC is the first fusion code to reach the teraflop speed in 2001 on the Seaborg computer at NERSC (2001), \emph{Lin, et al.} (2002)] and the petaflop in 2008 on the Jaguar computer at ORNL in production simulations [\emph{Xiao and Lin} (2009)]. Through collaborations with computer scientists from hardware vendors including NVIDIA and Inspur/Intel, the GTC production version was the first large scale fusion code to fully utilize the heterogeneous architectures using GPU (graphic processing unit) accelerators on Tianhe--lA [\emph{Meng, et al.} (2013)] and Titan, and using MIC (many integrated core) co--processors on Tianhe--2 [\emph{Dongarra} (2013)]. GTC has been selected by the DOE Center for Accelerated Application Readiness (CAAR), a program to prepare prominent codes across all DOE supported science research portfolio for the emerging exascale computers [\emph{CAAR}] such as the next generation computer Summit at ORNL. GTC has recently been ported to SummitDev, the prototype computer of Summit. GTC has received large time allocations on the supercomputers at NERSC and ORNL through the SciDAC, INCITE, ALCC, and CAAR projects. 

In the DOE--funded space of turbulent plasma transport codes, the only other code which may have the capacity for global turbulence study of the FRC is the XGC--I code [\emph{Chang and Ku} (2008)] at the Center for Edge Physics Simulation hosted at PPPL.

FPIC is not the first hybrid Particle--In--Cell (PIC) code to be used for global stability studies of FRCs. The HYM code [\emph{Belova, et al.} (2001)] has been used extensively to study FRC global stability in the past, including specific applications to TAE problems. Review of existing FRC stability studies makes it clear that the global stability properties of an FRC depend intricately on the end boundary conditions [\emph{Belova} (2015)], the shape of external current distributions [\emph{Yamada, et al.} (2007)], the shape of the separatrix and the plasma profiles [\emph{Parks and Schaffer} (2003)], and the level of kinetic influence [\emph{Milroy, et al.} (2008), \emph{Barnes and Milroy} (1991)]. All of these parameters may change during an FRC discharge; some of them are external actuators which may be used for feedback control. FPIC was developed by TAE because feedback and control of global stability is a requirement for the C--2W experimental program, and must work in order to achieve the TAE strategic goal. The feedback and control capability of FPIC is unique in the area of global stability PIC codes.
